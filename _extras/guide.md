Thank you for teaching high dimensional statistics with R! We hope you enjoy teaching the lesson. This page contains additional information for instructors.

The materials for each episode are self-contained and can be found through the episode links on the home page.

In previous rounds of teaching, the lesson was taught in four sessions, each lasting 2 hours and 50 minutes. We also advise allowing around 40 minutes of additional time for breaks. The recommended timings for each session are as follows:

Session 1: 
- Introduction to high-dimensional data (episode 1): 30 minutes of teaching time, 20 minutes for exercises (total: 50 minutes).
- Regression with many outcomes (episode 2): 70 minutes of teaching time, 50 minutes for exercises (total: 120 minutes).

Session 2:
- Regularised regression (episode 3): 110 minutes of teaching time, 60 minutes for exercises (total: 170 minutes).

Session 3:
- Principal component analysis (episode 4): 90 minutes of teaching time, 40 minutes for exercises (total: 130 minutes).
- Factor analysis (episode 5): 30 minutes of teaching time, 10 minutes for exercises (total: 40 minutes).
