<p>The purpose of this document is to summarise and track how the lesson
has developed in response to peer reviews, feedback from instructors and
Carpentries advice. We also detail the main changes that still need to
be made and thus define a roadmap to publication.</p>
<p>Note that the lesson has been developed over around 3 years and
iteratively improved. This document only highlights reviews contributed
by reviewers external to the main authors, except following rounds of
teaching. Details of other improvements can be found throughout the
repository and the list of authors is given in <a href="AUTHORS">AUTHORS</a>.</p>
<p>Thank you to our reviewers and instructors for their feedback. If you
would like to submit a review or pull request, please see our <a href="https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/high-dimensional-stats-r/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md" class="external-link">Contribution
Guide</a> for more information.</p>

<hr class="half-width"><p><strong>Review by Emma Rand on Episode 1: Introduction to
high-dimensional data (<a href="https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/high-dimensional-stats-r/issues/39" class="external-link">#39</a>)</strong></p>
<p>The reviewer liked this episode as an introduction to the course,
particularly that high-dimensional data were defined explicitly with
examples, that important points were reiterated in the text, and that
the motivation for using alternative methods when considering
high-dimensional data was given. The comments pertained to the entire
episode, with the big changes relating to elaborating and expanding the
questions or solutions for the challenges, inline code formatting and
elaborating reason for package use.</p>
<p>☑ Changes were made in line with all the suggestions exactly, and are
itemised in the issue and the associated points in <a href="https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/high-dimensional-stats-r/issues/64" class="external-link">#64</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Review by Emma Rand on Episode 2: Regression with many
outcomes (<a href="https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/high-dimensional-stats-r/issues/47%5D" class="external-link">#47</a>)</strong></p>
<p>The reviewer particularly liked that this episode demonstrates why we
need alternative approaches to regression for high-dimensional data and
the multiple testing section. Although many comments were given, the
reviewer highlighted that the episode was long, that new concepts should
be removed from Challenge 1 and that the smoking model figure should be
corrected. The review also highlighted issues with the remote theme.</p>
<p>☑ Changes were made in line with the suggestions exactly, including
reducing the length of the lesson. The changes are itemised in the
issue, the associated points in <a href="https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/high-dimensional-stats-r/issues/64" class="external-link">#64</a>
and the current version of the lesson.</p>
<p><strong>Review by Emma Rand on Episode 3: Regularised regression (<a href="https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/high-dimensional-stats-r/issues/49" class="external-link">#49</a>)</strong></p>
<p>The reviewer liked that the episode emphasises a genuine
understanding of the methods. Amongst the full review comments, the
reviewer commented that the episode is long and suggested some sections
to remove. The reviewer also suggested several points that could be
expanded to improve the use of statistical ‘jargon’ and drawing links
between jargon to make the episode more approachable to a biological
sciences audience.</p>
<p>☑ All the suggested changes were made and are detailed in the
issue.</p>
<p><strong>Review by Christie Barron on Episode 5: Factor analysis (<a href="https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/high-dimensional-stats-r/issues/53" class="external-link">#53</a>)</strong></p>
<p>Christie commented that it may be useful to discuss confirmatory
factor analysis in addition to exploratory factor analysis to clarify
that this is another approach that can be used. In addition, approaches
to factor enumeration could be discussed and R packages that make factor
analysis easier.</p>
<p>☑ All of the suggested changes were made and are detailed in the
issue and in commits 14584c8 and 3419337.</p>
<p><strong>Review by Mary Llewellyn on Episode 1: Introduction to
high-dimensional data (<a href="https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/high-dimensional-stats-r/issues/112" class="external-link">#112</a>)</strong></p>
<p>The reviewer liked that this episode struck a good balance between
motivating the course clearly whilst avoiding cognitive overload. The
reviewer suggested changes largely related to adding signposting,
foreshadowing to motivate the entire lesson from the start and
re-ordering paragraphs. The reviewer also suggested minor wording
changes to, for example, clarify the difference between the “Challenges”
(exercises) and “challenges” in the general sense and to ensure
learners, especially independent learners, had completed the setup
instructions.</p>
<p>☑ All the suggested changes were made, detailed in the issue. From
the discussions following this review, we have also clarified the
definition of high-dimensional data and plan to set up a data
description page <a href="https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/high-dimensional-stats-r/issues/132" class="external-link">#132</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Review by Mary Llewellyn on Episode 2: Regression with many
outcomes (<a href="https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/high-dimensional-stats-r/issues/114" class="external-link">#114</a>)</strong></p>
<p>The reviewer wrote that they really liked the episode and believed
it’s really valuable to explore many outcomes as well as many
predictors. They had a few queries on the episode and suggested mainly
that some of the more complex programming concepts could be removed to
avoid cognitive overload, and clarification about the motivation of the
episode as avoiding data dredging.</p>
<p>☑ All of the suggested changes were made and are detailed in the
issue.</p>
<p><strong>Review by Mary Llewellyn on Episode 3: Regularised regression
(<a href="https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/high-dimensional-stats-r/issues/115" class="external-link">#115</a>)</strong></p>
<p>The reviewer liked the episode and commented that, although it’s
long, it makes challenging ideas approachable. The suggestions largely
related to how regularisation is motivated and linking ideas to the
previous lesson, signposting, how singularities are described and the
placement of the linear regression section within the episode. Further
adjustments were recommended for independent learners.</p>
<p>☑ All of the suggested changes were made, detailed in the issue.</p>
<p><strong>Review by Mary Llewellyn on Episode 4: Principal Component
Analysis (<a href="https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/high-dimensional-stats-r/issues/117" class="external-link">#117</a>)</strong></p>
<p>The reviewer really liked the way that PCA is presented practically.
The main comments related to clarifying the motivation for various parts
of the episode, moving discussion of advantages and disadvantages to the
end of the episode, signposting, making it clearer when examples are
demonstrative and streamlining package use.</p>
<p>☑ All of the suggested changes were made and are detailed in the
issue. Various additional changes were made following the comments
(detailed in the issue), including refining the number of PCA packages
used to one, simplifying the scree plots and adding further detail to
the code comments.</p>
<p><strong>Review by Mary Llewellyn on Episode 5: Factor analysis (<a href="https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/high-dimensional-stats-r/issues/118" class="external-link">#118</a>)</strong></p>
<p>The reviewer thought that this episode was well-balanced with the
previous episode and had a few suggestions to differentiate between
factor analysis and PCA, how latent variables are defined, signposting,
moving discussion of advantages and disadvantages to the end of the
episode, some wording around the hypothesis tests, and some adaptations
for the individual learner.</p>
<p>☑ All of the suggested changes were made, detailed in the issue.
Additional changes were made following the comments with respect to
removing discussion of the rotations to reduce the likelihood of
cognitive overload.</p>
<p><strong>Review by Mary Llewellyn on Episode 6: K-means (<a href="https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/high-dimensional-stats-r/issues/119" class="external-link">#119</a>)</strong></p>
<p>The reviewer really liked that this episode builds gradually from an
initial example and stated that this makes the narrative very clear.
Most of the suggestions were with respect to wording, minor re-ordering
of sections, signposting and differentiating K-means from the methods
already introduced.</p>
<p>☑ All of the suggested changes were made and are detailed in the
issue.</p>
<p><strong>Review by Mary Llewellyn on Episode 7: Hierarchical
clustering (<a href="https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/high-dimensional-stats-r/issues/120" class="external-link">#120</a>)</strong></p>
<p>The reviewer liked how this episode built on K-means clustering on
the second episode and the use of visualisation to illustrate the
concepts in the episode. The suggestions related to adding further
motivation for the episode, structural re-ordering, annotating plots and
code, and signposting.</p>
<p>☑ All of the suggested changes were made and are detailed in the
issue.</p>

<hr class="half-width"><p><strong>Feedback from teaching 21st October 2021 (<a href="https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/high-dimensional-stats-r/issues/33" class="external-link">#33</a>)</strong></p>
<p>Overall, the learners liked that the practical examples were clear
and easily understood by biologists, the slides were informative and
well-presented, and they liked how useful the lesson is. They
particularly noted that they liked the pace and depth of the first two
episodes and the visualisations in episode 7.</p>
<p>There were some issues with equation rendering in chrome and some
learners found that the pace could be a little faster in places.
Episode-specific comments noted that episode 3 was too theoretical,
episodes 4 and 5 could contain more code comments for learners looking
back on the course and episodes 6 and 7 could contain more examples and
give an overview of the general steps of each method/when each is
useful.</p>
<p>☑ The lesson as been iteratively improved over time. As such, episode
3 is now presented much more practically (fewer mathematical
expressions, existing theoretical concepts are more clearly and
practically motivated, additional content such as Bayesian methods have
been removed to focus on the concepts already introduced). Episodes 4
and 5 have almost completely changed and the code is commented and
motivated much more clearly. Episodes 6 and 7 now motivate the practical
uses of each method more clearly. From teaching, the course was also
improved by shortening the introduction to focus only on the
difficulties of high-dimensional data, episode 3 was presented from a
more practical perspective and episode 5 was made more detailed.</p>
<p><strong>Additional changes following teaching from February-June 2022
(<a href="https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/high-dimensional-stats-r/issues/33" class="external-link">#52</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/high-dimensional-stats-r/pull/57" class="external-link">#57</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/high-dimensional-stats-r/pull/63" class="external-link">#63</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/high-dimensional-stats-r/issues/64" class="external-link">#64</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/high-dimensional-stats-r/issues/76" class="external-link">#76</a>)</strong></p>
<p>Several other changes following notes and feedback from teaching are
detailed in these issues.</p>
<p><strong>Feedback from Edward Wallace from teaching September 2022 (<a href="https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/high-dimensional-stats-r/issues/86" class="external-link">#86</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/high-dimensional-stats-r/issues/88" class="external-link">#88</a>)</strong></p>
<p>The learners found the lessons relevant to their work, particularly
episodes 4 and 5, which they thought were explained really well, were
practical and easily to follow, and introduced concepts they found
important to their work at a level that was understandable to them. They
said that the way these episodes were presented helped them to fill the
gaps in their understanding from practical implementation. They also
particularly liked the coding and visualisation in episode 3.</p>
<p>Many of the comments related to timings (allowing more time) and
clarifying wording.</p>
<p>☑ Changes were made in response to most comments in <a href="https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/high-dimensional-stats-r/issues/86" class="external-link">#86</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/high-dimensional-stats-r/issues/88" class="external-link">#89</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/high-dimensional-stats-r/pull/167" class="external-link">#167</a>,
and any remaining changes are evident in the current lesson.</p>
<p><strong>Feedback from February 2024 teaching (<a href="https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/high-dimensional-stats-r/issues/145" class="external-link">#145</a>)</strong></p>
<p>The instructors liked teaching the course and found it fun to teach.
Comments largely related to timing adjustments, explaining packages,
adjusting the way the factor analysis episode is presented and some
structural changes to the first three episodes.</p>
<p>☑ Changes in response to this feedback are documented in the
issue.</p>
