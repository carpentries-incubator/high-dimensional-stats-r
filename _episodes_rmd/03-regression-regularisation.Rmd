- Test and training splits, or cross-validation, are a useful way to select

- Regularisation can give us a more predictive set of variables, and by
  restricting the magnitude of coefficients, can give us a better
  (and more stable) estimate of our outcome.
- Regularisation is often *very* fast! Compared to other methods for variable
  selection, it is very efficient. This makes it easier to practice rigorous
  variable selection.

# Introduction


This episode is about **regularisation**, also called **regularised regression** 
or **penalised regression**. This approach can be used for prediction and for 
feature selection and it is particularly useful when dealing with high-dimensional data.

One reason that we need special statistical tools for high-dimensional data is
that standard linear models cannot handle high-dimensional data sets -- one cannot fit
a linear model where there are more features (predictor variables) than there are observations
(data points). In the previous lesson we dealt with this problem by fitting individual
models for each feature and sharing information among these models. Now we will
take a look at an alternative approach called regularisation. Regularisation can be used to
stabilise coefficient estimates (and thus to fit models with more features than observations)
and even to select a subset of relevant features.

First, let us check out what happens if we try to fit a linear model to high-dimensional
data! We start by reading in the data from the last lesson:


```{r loadmethy}
library("here")
library("minfi")
methylation <- readRDS(here("data/methylation.rds"))

## here, we transpose the matrix to have features as rows and samples as columns
methyl_mat <- t(assay(methylation))
age <- methylation$Age
```

Then, we try to fit a model with outcome age and all 5,000 features in this
dataset as predictors (average methylation levels, M-values, across different
sites in the genome).

```{r fitall, R.options=list(max.print=20)}
# by using methyl_mat in the formula below, R will run a multivariate regression
# model in which each of the columns in methyl_mat is used as a predictor. 
fit <- lm(age ~ methyl_mat)
summary(fit)
```

You can see that we're able to get some effect size estimates, but they seem very 
high! The summary also says that we were unable to estimate
effect sizes for `r format(sum(is.na(coef(fit))), big.mark=",")` features
because of "singularities". What this means is that R couldn't find a way to
perform the calculations necessary due to the fact that we have more features
than observations.

# Coefficient estimates of a linear model

When we fit a linear model, we're finding the line through our data that 
minimises the sum of the squared residuals. We can think of that as finding
the slope and intercept that minimises the square of the length of the dashed
lines. In this case, the red line in the left panel is the line that
accomplishes this objective, and the red dot in the right panel is the point 
that represents this line in terms of its slope and intercept among many 
different possible models, where the background colour represents how well
different combinations of slope and intercept accomplish this objective.

```{r regplot, echo = FALSE, fig.cap="Cap", fig.alt="Alt", fig.width=10}
library("viridis")
set.seed(42)
noise_sd <- 1
nobs <- 50
slope <- 2
intercept <- 2

maxlim <- max(abs(slope), abs(intercept)) * 2
maxlim <- max(maxlim, 5)
lims <- c(-maxlim, maxlim)

l2 <- 2
x <- rnorm(nobs, mean = 0, sd = 1)
noise <- rnorm(nobs, mean = 0, sd = noise_sd)
y <- (slope * x) + (intercept) + noise

n <- 200
s <- seq(-maxlim, maxlim, length.out = n)
loglik <- function(slope, intercept, x, y, noise_sd) {
    sum(dnorm(y, mean = (slope * x) + intercept, sd = noise_sd, log = TRUE))
}

ll <- matrix(ncol = n, nrow = n)
coef <- mask <- norm_mat <- matrix(ncol = n, nrow = n)
for (i in seq_along(s)) {
    coef[, ] <- s
}
for (i in seq_along(s)) {
    for (j in seq_along(s)) {
        norm_mat[i, j] <- sqrt(s[[i]]^2 + s[[j]]^2)
        ll[i, j] <- loglik(s[i], s[j], x, y, noise_sd)
    }
}
mask <- norm_mat <= l2
ind_mle <- arrayInd(which.max(ll), dim(ll))
pll <- ll * as.numeric(mask)
pll[pll == 0] <- NA
ind_ple <- arrayInd(which.max(pll), dim(pll))

par(mfrow = 1:2)
plot(x, y, pch = 19)
abline(
    a = coef[ind_mle[[2]]],
    b = coef[ind_mle[[1]]],
    col = "firebrick"
)
yhat <- x
for (i in seq_along(x)) {
    yhat[[i]] <- (x[[i]] * coef[ind_mle[[1]]]) + coef[ind_mle[[2]]]
    lines(
        x = rep(x[[i]], each = 2), y = c(yhat[[i]], y[[i]]),
        lty = "dashed"
    )
}

image(s, s, ll,
    xlab = "slope", ylab = "intercept",
    col = viridis(40, option = "A", direction = 1),
    xlim = lims, ylim = lims
)
abline(v = 0, lty = "dashed")
abline(h = 0, lty = "dashed")
points(
    coef[ind_mle[[1]]], coef[ind_mle[[2]]],
    pch = 19, cex = 2, col = "firebrick"
)
```

Mathematically, we can write the sum of squared residuals as

$$
    \sum_{i=1}^N ( y_i-x'_i\beta)^2
$$

where $\beta$ is a vector of (unknown) covariate effects which we want to learn
by fitting a regression model: the $j$-th element of $\beta$, which we denote as 
$\beta_j$ quantifies the effect of the $j$-th covariate. For each individual 
$i$, $x_i$ is a vector of covariate values, $y_i$ is the true observed value for 
the outcome and $\hat{y}_i$ is the predicted outcome value. The notation 
$x'_i\beta$ indicates matrix multiplication. In this case, the result is 
equivalent to multiplying each element of $x_i$ by its corresponding element in 
$\beta$ and then calculating the sum across all of those values. To quantify 
the total error across all individuals, we sum the square residuals 
$( y_i-x'_i\beta)^2$ across all the individuals in our data. 


Finding the value of $\beta$ that minimises
the sum above is the line of best fit through our data when considering 
this goal of minimising the sum of squared error. However, it is not the only 
possible line we could use! For example, we might want to err on the side of
caution when estimating effect sizes (coefficients). That is, we might want to 
avoid estimating very large effect sizes. This can help us to create *generalisable*
models. This is important when models that are fitted (trained) on one dataset
and then used to predict outcomes from a new dataset. Restricting parameter
estimates is particularly important when analysing high-dimensional data.

# Model selection using training and test sets

Sets of models are often compared using statistics such as adjusted $R^2$, AIC or BIC.
These show us how well the model is learning the data used in fitting that same model [^1].
However, these statistics do not really tell us how well the model will generalise to new data.
This is an important thing to  consider -- if our model doesn't generalise to new data,
then there's a chance that it's just picking up on a technical or batch effect
in our data, or simply some noise that happens to fit the outcome we're modelling.
This is especially important when our goal is prediction -- it's not much good
if we can only predict well for samples where the outcome is already known,
after all! 

To get an idea of how well our model generalises, we can split the data into
two - a "training" and a "test" set. We use the "training" data to fit the model,
and then see its performance on the "test" data.

```{r validation, echo = FALSE, out.width = "500px", fig.cap = "Title", fig.alt = "Alt"}
knitr::include_graphics("../fig/validation.png")
```

One thing that often happens in this context is that large 
coefficient values minimise the training error, but they don't minimise the 
test error on unseen data. First, we'll go through an example of what exactly 
this means.

For the next few challenges, we'll work with a set of features
known to be associated with age from a paper by Horvath et al.[^2]. Horvath et al
use methylation markers alone to predict the biological age of an individual.
This is useful in studying age-related disease amongst many other things.

```{r coefhorvath}
coef_horvath <- readRDS(here::here("data/coefHorvath.rds"))
methylation <- readRDS(here::here("data/methylation.rds"))

library("SummarizedExperiment")
age <- methylation$Age
methyl_mat <- t(assay(methylation))

coef_horvath <- coef_horvath[1:20, ]
features <- coef_horvath$CpGmarker
horvath_mat <- methyl_mat[, features]

## Generate an index to split the data
set.seed(42)
train_ind <- sample(nrow(methyl_mat), 25)
```

Having trained this model, now we can check how well it does in predicting age
from new dataset (the test data).
Here we use the mean of the squared difference between our predictions and the
true ages for the test data, or "mean squared error" (MSE). Unfortunately, it
seems like this is a lot higher than the error on the training data!


```{r}
mse <- function(true, prediction) {
    mean((true - prediction)^2)
}
pred_lm <- predict(fit_horvath, newdata = as.data.frame(test_mat))
err_lm <- mse(test_age, pred_lm)
err_lm
```

Further, if we plot true age against predicted age for the samples in the test
set, we can see how well we're really doing - ideally these would line up
exactly!

```{r test-plot-lm, fig.cap="Cap", fig.alt="Alt"}
par(mfrow = c(1, 1))
plot(test_age, pred_lm, pch = 19)
abline(coef = 0:1, lty = "dashed")
```

This figure shows the predicted ages obtained from a linear model fit plotted 
against the true ages, which we kept in the test dataset. If the prediction were 
good, the dots should follow a line. Regularisation can help us to make the 
model more generalisable, improving predictions for the test dataset (or any 
other dataset that is not used when fitting our model). 

# Using regularisation to impove generalisability

As stated above, restricting model parameter estimates can improve a model's
generalisability. This can be done with *regularisation*. The idea to add another
condition to the problem we're solving with linear regression. This condition
controls the total size of the  coefficients that come out. 
For example, we might say that the point representing the slope and intercept
must fall within a certain distance of the origin, $(0, 0)$. Note that we are 
still trying to solve for the line that minimises the square of the residuals; 
we are just adding this extra constraint to our solution. 

For the 2-parameter model (slope and intercept), we could
visualise this constraint as a circle with a given radius. We 
want to find the "best" solution (in terms of minimising the 
residuals) that also falls within a circle of a given radius 
(in this case, `r l2`).

```{r ridgeplot, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Cap", fig.alt = "Alt", fig.width = 10}
set.seed(42)
par(mfrow = 1:2)
plot(x, y, pch = 19)
abline(
    a = coef[ind_ple[[2]]],
    b = coef[ind_ple[[1]]], col = "dodgerblue"
)
abline(
    a = coef[ind_mle[[2]]],
    b = coef[ind_mle[[1]]], col = "firebrick"
)

image(s, s, ll,
    xlab = "slope", ylab = "intercept",
    col = viridis(40, option = "A", direction = 1),
    xlim = lims, ylim = lims
)
abline(v = 0, lty = "dashed")
abline(h = 0, lty = "dashed")
points(
    coef[ind_mle[[1]]], coef[ind_mle[[2]]],
    pch = 19, cex = 2, col = "firebrick"
)
contour(
    s, s, norm_mat,
    add = TRUE, levels = l2, drawlabels = FALSE
)
points(
    coef[ind_ple[[1]]], coef[ind_ple[[2]]],
    pch = 19, cex = 2, col = "dodgerblue"
)
par(mfrow = c(1, 1))
```

There are multiple ways to define the distance that our solution must fall in,
though. The one we've plotted above controls the squared sum of the 
coefficients, $\beta$.
This is also sometimes called the $L^2$ norm. This is defined as

$$
    \left\lVert \beta\right\lVert_2 = \sqrt{\sum_{j=1}^p \beta_j^2} 
$$

To control this, we specify that the solution for the equation above
also has to have an $L^2$ norm smaller than a certain amount. Or, equivalently,
we try to minimise a function that includes our $L^2$ norm scaled by a 
factor that is usually written $\lambda$.

$$
     \sum_{i=1}^N \biggl( y_i - x'_i\beta\biggr)^2  + \lambda \left\lVert \beta \right\lVert_2 ^2
$$

Another way of thinking about this is that when finding the best model, we're
weighing up a balance of the ordinary least squares objective and a "penalty"
term that punished models with large coefficients. The balance between the
penalty and the ordinary least squares objective is controlled by $\lambda$ - 
when $\lambda$ is large, we care a lot about the size of the coefficients.
When it's small, we don't really care a lot. When it's zero, we're back to
just using ordinary least squares. This type of regularisation is called *ridge regression*.

# Why would we want to restrict our model?

It may seem an odd thing to do: to restrict the possible values of our model
parameters! Why would we want to do this? Firstly, as discussed earlier, our 
model estimates can be very unstable or even difficult to calculate when we have 
many correlated features. Secondly, this type of approach can make our model more 
generalisable to new data. To show this, we'll fit a model using the same set
of 20 features (stored as `features`) selected earlier in this episode (these
are a subset of the features identified by Horvarth et al), using both 
regularised and ordinary least squares.

```{r plot-ridge, fig.cap="Cap", fig.alt="Alt"}
library("glmnet")

## glmnet() performs scaling by default, supply un-scaled data:
horvath_mat <- methyl_mat[, features] # select the first 20 sites as before
train_mat <- horvath_mat[train_ind, ] # use the same individuals as selected before
test_mat <- horvath_mat[-train_ind, ]



ridge_fit <- glmnet(x = train_mat, y = train_age, alpha = 0)
plot(ridge_fit, xvar = "lambda")
abline(h = 0, lty = "dashed")
```

This plot shows how the estimated coefficients for each methrylated site  change
as we increase the penalty, $\lambda$. That is,
as we decrease the size of the region that solutions can fall into, the values
of the coefficients that we get back tend to decrease. In this case,
coefficients trend towards zero but generally don't reach it until the penalty
gets very large. We can see that initially, some parameter estimates are really,
really large, and these tend to shrink fairly rapidly.

We can also notice that some parameters "flip signs"; that is, they start off
positive and become negative as lambda grows. This is a sign of collinearity,
or correlated predictors. As we reduce the importance of one feature, we can 
"make up for" the loss in accuracy from that one feature by adding a bit of
weight to another feature that represents similar information.

Since we split the data into test and training data, we can prove that ridge
regression gives us a better prediction in this case:

```{r pred-ridge-lm, fig.width = 10, fig.cap="Cap", fig.alt="Alt"}
pred_ridge <- predict(ridge_fit, newx = test_mat)
err_ridge <- apply(pred_ridge, 2, function(col) mse(test_age, col))
min(err_ridge)
err_lm

which_min_err <- which.min(err_ridge)
min_err_ridge <- min(err_ridge)
pred_min_ridge <- pred_ridge[, which_min_err]
```

We can see where on the continuum of lambdas we've picked a model by plotting
the coefficient paths again. In this case, we've picked a model with fairly
modest shrinkage.

```{r chooselambda, fig.cap="Cap", fig.alt="Alt"}
chosen_lambda <- ridge_fit$lambda[which.min(err_ridge)]
plot(ridge_fit, xvar = "lambda")
abline(v = log(chosen_lambda), lty = "dashed")
```

# LASSO regression

*LASSO* is another type of regularisation. In this case we use the $L^1$ norm,
or the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients.

$$
    \left\lVert \beta \right\lVert_1 = \sum_{j=1}^p |\beta_j|
$$

This tends to produce sparse models; that is to say, it tends to remove features
from the model that aren't necessary to produce accurate predictions. This
is because the region we're restricting the coefficients to has sharp edges.
So, when we increase the penalty (reduce the norm), it's more likely that
the best solution that falls in this region will be at the corner of this
diagonal (i.e., one or more coefficient is exactly zero).

```{r shrink-lasso, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Title", fig.alt = "Alt", fig.width=10}
loglik <- function(slope, intercept, x, y, noise_sd) {
    sum(dnorm(y, mean = (slope * x) + intercept, sd = noise_sd, log = TRUE))
}
drawplot <- function() {
    set.seed(42)
    noise_sd <- 1
    nobs <- 200
    slope <- 2
    intercept <- 2
    maxlim <- max(abs(slope), abs(intercept)) * 2
    maxlim <- max(maxlim, 5)
    lims <- c(-maxlim, maxlim)
    l1 <- 2
    x <- rnorm(nobs, mean = 0, sd = 1)
    noise <- rnorm(nobs, mean = 0, sd = noise_sd)
    y <- (slope * x) + (intercept) + noise

# Cross-validation to find the best value of $\lambda$

There are various methods to select the "best"
value for $\lambda$. One is to split
the data into $K$ chunks. We then use $K-1$ of
these as the training set, and the remaining $1$ chunk
as the test set. We can repeat this until we've rotated through all $K$ chunks,
giving us a good estimate of how well each of the lambda values work in our
data. This is called cross-validation, and doing this repeated test/train split
gives us a better estimate of how generalisable our model is. Cross-validation
is a really deep topic that we're not going to cover in more detail today, though!

```{r cvfig, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Title", fig.alt = "Alt"}
knitr::include_graphics("../fig/cross_validation.png")
```

We can use this new idea to choose a lambda value, by finding the lambda
that minimises the error across each of the test and training splits.

```{r lasso-cv, fig.cap="Lasso", fig.alt="Alt"}
lasso <- cv.glmnet(methyl_mat[, -1], age, alpha = 1)
plot(lasso)
coefl <- coef(lasso, lasso$lambda.min)
selected_coefs <- as.matrix(coefl)[which(coefl != 0), 1]

## load the horvath signature to compare features
coef_horvath <- readRDS(here::here("data/coefHorvath.rds"))
## We select some of the same features! Hooray
intersect(names(selected_coefs), coef_horvath$CpGmarker)
```

```{r heatmap-lasso, echo = FALSE, fig.cap="Heatmap", fig.alt="Alt"}
hmat <- t(scale(methyl_mat[, names(selected_coefs)[-1]]))
ord <- order(age)
hmat_ord <- hmat[, ord]
age_ord <- age[ord]
col <- circlize::colorRamp2(seq(min(age), max(age), length.out = 100), viridis(100))
Heatmap(
    hmat_ord,
    name = "Scaled\nmethylation level",
    top_annotation = columnAnnotation(
        age = age_ord,
        col = list(age = col)
    ),
    show_column_names = FALSE,
    column_title = "Sample",
    row_title = "Feature",
    row_names_side = "left",
    row_title_side = "left",
    column_title_side = "bottom",
    show_row_dend = FALSE,
    cluster_columns = FALSE
)

# Blending ridge regression and the LASSO - elastic nets

So far, we've used ridge regression, where `alpha = 0`, and LASSO regression,
where `alpha = 1`. What if `alpha` is set to a value between zero and one?
Well, this actually lets us blend the properties of ridge and LASSO
regression. This allows us to have the nice properties of the LASSO, where
uninformative variables are dropped automatically, and the nice properties
of ridge regression, where our coefficient estimates are a bit more
conservative, and as a result our predictions are a bit better.

Formally, the objective function of elastic net regression is to optimise the
following function:

$$
    \left(\sum_{i=1}^N y_i - X_i\beta\right)
        + \lambda \left(
            \alpha \left\lVert \beta \right\lVert_1 +
            (1-\alpha)  \left\lVert \beta \right\lVert_2
        \right)
$$

You can see that if `alpha = 1`, then the L1 norm term is multiplied by one,
and the L2 norm is multiplied by zero. This means we have pure LASSO regression.
Conversely, if `alpha = 0`, the L2 norm term is multiplied by one, and the L1
norm is multiplied by zero, meaning we have pure ridge regression. Anything
in between gives us something in between.

The contour plots we looked at previously to visualise what this penalty looks
like for different values of `alpha`.

```{r elastic-contour, fig.width = 16, echo = FALSE}
plot_elastic <- function(alpha) {
    set.seed(42)
    noise_sd <- 1

    x <- rnorm(nobs, mean = 0, sd = 1)
    noise <- rnorm(nobs, mean = 0, sd = noise_sd)
    y <- (slope * x) + (intercept) + noise

    n <- 200
    s <- seq(-maxlim, maxlim, length.out = n)

                (sqrt(s[[i]]^2 + s[[j]]^2) * ((1 - alpha))) +
                ((abs(s[[i]]) + abs(s[[j]])) * (alpha))
            )
            ll[i, j] <- loglik(s[i], s[j], x, y, noise_sd)
        }
    }
