# Calculating a t-statistic

The t-statistic for the $k^{th}$ linear model coefficient is defined as

$t_{k} = \frac{\hat{\beta}_{k}}{SE\left(\hat{\beta}_{k}\right)}$

This means that large $\beta$ estimates *or* small $SE(\beta)$ estimates
lead to large test statistics.

# Calculating FDR p-values

1. Rank the p-values
2. Assign each a rank (1 is smallest)
3. Calculate the critical value 
    $$
        q = \left(\frac{i}{m}\right)Q
    $$,
    where $i$ is rank, $m$ is the number of tests, and $Q$ is the
    false discovery rate we want to target.[^5]
4. Find the largest p-value less than the critical value.
    All smaller than this are significant.

# Comparing FWER and FDR properties

|FWER|FDR|
|:-------------|:--------------|
|+ Controls probability of identifying a false positive|+ Controls rate of false discoveries|
|+ Strict error rate control |+ Allows error control with less stringency|
|- Very conservative |- Does not control probability of making errors|
|- Requires larger statistical power|- May result in false discoveries|
