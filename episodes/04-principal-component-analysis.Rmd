# Introduction

If a dataset contains many variables ($p$), it is likely that some of these 
variables will be highly correlated. Variables may even be so highly correlated 
that they represent the same overall effect. Such datasets are challenging 
to analyse for several reasons, with the main problem being how to reduce 
dimensionality in the dataset while retaining the important features. 

In this episode we will explore *principal component analysis* (PCA) as a
popular method of analysing high-dimensional data. PCA is a
statistical method which allows large datasets of correlated variables to be
summarised into smaller numbers of uncorrelated principal components that
explain most of the variability in the original dataset. As an example,
PCA might reduce several variables representing aspects of patient health 
(blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate) into a single feature capturing
an overarching "patient health" effect. This is useful from an exploratory point 
of view, discovering how variables might be associated and combined. The 
resulting principal component could also be used as an effect in further analysis 
(e.g. linear regression).

# Principal component analysis

PCA transforms a dataset of continuous variables into a new set of uncorrelated variables called "principal components". The first principal component derived explains the largest amount of the variability
in the underlying dataset. The second principal component derived explains the second largest amount of variability in the dataset and so on. Once the dataset has been transformed into principal components, we can extract a subset of the principal components in order of the variance they explain (starting with the first principal component that by definition explains the most variability, and then the second), giving new variables that explain a lot of the variability in the original dataset. Thus, PCA helps us to produce a lower dimensional dataset while keeping most of the information in the original dataset.

To see what these new principal components may look like, the figure below shows the log-transformed prostate specific antigen (`lpsa`) versus cancer 
volume (`lcavol`) data from the `prostate` data set introduced in Episode 1. Principal components are a collection of new, artificial data points, one for each individual observation called _scores_. 
The red line on the plot represents the line passing through the scores (points) of the first principal component for each observation.
The angle that the first principal component line passes through the data points at is set to the direction with the highest 
variability. The plotted first principal components can therefore be thought of reflecting the 
effect in the data that has the highest variability. The second principal component explains the next highest amount of variability 
in the data and is represented by the line perpendicular to the first (the green line). The second principal component can be thought of as
capturing the overall effect in the data that has the second-highest variability.

The animation below illustrates how principal components are calculated from
data. You can imagine that the black line is a rod and each red dashed line is
a spring. The energy of each spring is proportional to its squared length. The
direction of the first principal component is the one that minimises the total
energy of all of the springs. In the animation below, the springs pull the rod,
finding the direction of the first principal component when they reach
equilibrium. We then use the length of the springs from the rod as the first
principal component.
This is explained in more detail on [this Q&A website](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/2691/making-sense-of-principal-component-analysis-eigenvectors-eigenvalues).

In summary, the principal components' values are called _scores_. The loadings can
be thought of as the degree to which each original variable contributes to 
the principal component scores. In this episode, we will see how to perform PCA to summarise the information in high-dimensional datasets.

# How do we perform a PCA?

To illustrate how to perform PCA initially, we revisit the low-dimensional `prostate` dataset. 
The data come from a study which examined the
correlation between the level of prostate specific antigen and a number of
clinical measures in 97 men who were about to receive a radical prostatectomy.
The data have 97 rows and 9 columns.

The variables in the dataset (columns) are:
- `lcavol` (log-transformed cancer volume),
- `lweight` (log-transformed prostate weight),
- `lbph` (log-transformed amount of benign prostate enlargement),
- `svi` (seminal vesicle invasion),
- `lcp` (log-transformed capsular penetration; amount of spread of cancer in
   outer walls of prostate),
- `gleason` (Gleason score; grade of cancer cells),
- `pgg45` (percentage Gleason scores 4 or 5),
- `lpsa` (log-transformed prostate specific antigen; level of PSA in blood).
- `age` (patient age in years).

We will perform PCA on the five continuous clinical variables in our dataset
so that we can create fewer variables representing clinical markers of cancer progression.


First, we will examine the `prostate` dataset (originally part of the
**`lasso2`** package):

```{r prostate-load}
prostate <- readRDS(here("data/prostate.rds"))
```

```{r prostate-head}
head(prostate)
```

Note that each row of the dataset represents a single patient.

We will create a subset of the data including only the clinical variables we
want to use in the PCA.

```{r pros2}
pros2 <- prostate[, c("lcavol", "lweight", "lbph", "lcp", "lpsa")]
head(pros2)
```

## Do we need to scale the data?

PCA derives principal components based on the variance they explain in the data. Therefore, we may need to apply some pre-processing to scale variables in our dataset if we want to ensure that each variable is considered equally by the PCA. Scaling is essential if we want to avoid the PCA ignoring variables that may be important to our analysis just because they take low values and have low variance. We do not need to scale if we want variables with low variance to carry less weight in the PCA.

In this example, we want each variable to be treated equally by the PCA since variables with lower values may be just as informative as variables with higher values. Let's therefore investigate the variables in our dataset to see if we need to scale our variables first:

```{r var-hist, fig.cap="Histograms of two variables from the prostate data set.", fig.alt="Side-by-side histograms of two variables from the dataset, lweight on the left and lbph on the right. The histogram for the lweight data ranges from around 2 to 6 on the x axis, while the histogram for the lbph ranges from around -2 to 3 on the x axis."}
apply(pros2, 2, var)
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
hist(pros2$lweight, breaks = "FD")
hist(pros2$lbph, breaks = "FD")
```

Note that variance is greatest for `lbph` and lowest for `lweight`. Since we 
want each of the variables to be treated equally in our PCA, but there are large differences in the variances of the variables, we need to scale each of the variables before including
them in a PCA to ensure that differences in variances 
do not drive the calculation of principal components. In this example, we
standardise all five variables to have a mean of 0 and a standard
deviation of 1.

## Performing PCA

Throughout this episode, we will carry out PCA using the Bioconductor package **`PCAtools`**.
This package provides several functions that are useful for exploring data via PCA and
producing useful figures and analysis tools. The package is made for the somewhat unusual
Bioconductor style of data tables (observations in columns, features in rows). When
using Bioconductor data sets and **`PCAtools`**, it is thus not necessary to transpose the data.
You can use the help files in the package documentation to find out about the `pca()`
function (type `help("pca")` or `?pca` in R). Although we focus on PCA implementation using this package, there are several other
options for performing PCA, including a base R function, `prcomp()`. Equivalent functions and 
output labels for the common implementations are summarised below.

| library::command()| PC scores | Loadings |
|-------------------|-----------|----------|
| stats::prcomp()   | $x         | $rotation |
| stats::princomp() | $scores    | $loadings | 
| PCAtools::pca()   | $rotated   | $loadings | 


Let's use the **`PCAtools`** package to perform PCA on the scaled `prostate` data. First, let's load the **`PCAtools`** package.

```{r pcatools}
library("PCAtools")
```


The input data (`pros2`) is in the form of a matrix and we need to take the transpose of this 
matrix and convert it to a data frame for use within the **`PCAtools`** package. We set the `scale = TRUE` argument to standardise the variables to have a mean 0 and standard deviation of 1 as above. 


```{r prcomp}
pros2t <- data.frame(t(pros2))  #create transposed data frame
colnames(pros2t)<-seq(1:dim(pros2t)[2]) #rename columns for use within PCAtools
pmetadata= data.frame("M"=rep(1, dim(pros2t)[2]), row.names = colnames(pros2t)) #create fake metadata for use with PCA tools

##implement PCA
pca.pros <- pca(pros2t, scale = TRUE, center = TRUE,metadata = pmetadata)
pca.pros$loadings #return pca loadings 
```

# How many principal components do we need?

We have calculated one principal component for each variable in the original
dataset. How do we choose how many of these are necessary to represent the true
variation in the data, without having extra components that are unnecessary?

Let's look at the relative importance of (percentage of the variance explained by) the components:


```{r summ}
prop.var <- round(pca.pros$variance, 4) #round to 4 decimal places
prop.var
```

This returns the proportion of variance in the data explained by each of the
principal components. In this example, the first principal component, PC1, explains approximately
`r round(prop.var[[1]])`% of variance in the data, PC2 `r round(prop.var[[2]])`% of variance,
PC3 a further `r round(prop.var[[3]])`%, PC4 approximately `r round(prop.var[[4]])`% and PC5
around `r round(prop.var[[5]])`%.

Let's visualise this. A plot of the amount of variance accounted for by each PC
is also called a scree plot. Often, scree plots show a characteristic pattern 
where initially, the variance drops rapidly with each additional principal component. But then there is an “elbow” after which the
variance decreases more slowly. The total variance explained up to the elbow point is sometimes
interpreted as structural variance that is relevant and should be retained versus noise
which may be discarded after the elbow. 

We can create a scree plot using the **`PCAtools`** function `screeplot()`:

```{r varexp, fig.cap="Scree plot showing the percentage of the variance explained by the principal components calculated from the prostate data.", fig.alt="A scree plot showing the percentage of variance explained by each principal component versus the principal component number. The points are joined by lines to indicate where the elbow of the scree plot occurs."}
screeplot(pca.pros, axisLabSize = 5, titleLabSize = 8, 
          drawCumulativeSumLine = FALSE, drawCumulativeSumPoints = FALSE) +
    geom_line(aes(x = 1:length(pca.pros$components), y = as.numeric(pca.pros$variance))) 
#add line to scree plot to visualise the elbow
```

The scree plot shows that the first principal component explains most of the
variance in the data (>50%) and each subsequent principal component explains
less and less of the total variance. The first two principal components
explain >70% of variance in the data. 

Selecting a subset of principal components results in loss of 
information from the original dataset but selecting principal components to 
summarise the _majority_ of the information in the original dataset is useful
from a practical dimension reduction perspective. There are no clear guidelines 
on how many principal components should be included in PCA. 
We often look at the 'elbow’ on the scree plot as an
indicator that the addition of principal components does not drastically
contribute to explaining the remaining variance. In this case, the 'elbow' of the scree plot appears
to be at the third principal component. We may therefore conclude that three principal
components are sufficient to explain the majority of the variability in the original 
dataset. We may also choose another criterion, such as an arbitrary cut-off for 
the proportion of the variance explained compared to other principal components. 
Essentially, the criterion used to select principal components should be determined 
based on what is deemed a sufficient level of information retention for a specific 
dataset and question.


## Loadings and principal component scores

Most PCA functions will produce two main output matrices: the
*principal component scores* and the *loadings*. The matrix of principal component scores
has as many rows as there were observations in the input matrix. These
scores are what is usually visualised or used for down-stream analyses.
The matrix of loadings (also called rotation matrix) has as many rows as there
are features in the original data. It contains information about how the
(usually centered and scaled) original data relate to the principal component scores.

We can print the loadings for the **`PCAtools`** implementation using 

```{r pca-pros}
pca.pros$loadings
```


The principal component scores are obtained by carrying out matrix multiplication of the
(usually centered and scaled) original data times the loadings. The following
callout demonstrates this.

The left scatter plot is the same as the right scatter plot but with swapped axes."}

> # Note that the axis orientations may be swapped but the relative positions of the dots should be the same in both plots.
> ```
{: .callout}



One way to visualise how principal components relate to the original variables
is by creating a biplot. Biplots usually show two principal components plotted
against each other. Observations are sometimes labelled with numbers. The
contribution of each original variable to the principal components displayed
is then shown by arrows (generated from those two columns of the rotation matrix that
correspond to the principal components shown). See `help("PCAtools::biplot")` for
arguments and their meaning. For instance, `lab` or `colBy` may be useful.
Note that there are several biplot
implementations in different R libraries. It is thus a good idea to specify
the desired package when calling `biplot()`. A biplot of the first two principal
components can be generated as follows:


```{r stats-biplot, fig.cap="Scatter plot of the first two principal components with observations numerically labelled.", fig.alt="Scatter plot of the second principal component versus the first principal component. Observations as points, numerically labelled."}
PCAtools::biplot(pca.pros)
```

This biplot shows the position of each patient on a 2-dimensional plot where
loadings can be observed via the red arrows associated with each of
the variables. The variables `lpsa`, `lcavol` and `lcp` are associated with
positive values on PC1 while positive values on PC2 are associated with the
variables `lbph` and `lweight`. The length of the arrows indicates how much
each variable contributes to the calculation of each principal component.

The left and bottom axes show normalised principal component scores. The axes
on the top and right of the plot are used to interpret the loadings, where
loadings are scaled by the standard deviation of the principal components
(`pca.pros$sdev`) times the square root the number of observations.


# Advantages and disadvantages of PCA

Advantages:
* It is a relatively easy to use and popular method. 
* Various software/packages are available to run a PCA.
* The calculations used in a PCA are simple to understand compared to other methods for dimension reduction. 

Disadvantages:
* It assumes that variables in a dataset are correlated.
* It is sensitive to the scale at which input variables are measured.
  If input variables are measured at different scales, the variables
  with large variance relative to the scale of measurement will have
  greater impact on the principal components relative to variables with smaller
  variance. In many cases, this is not desirable.
* It is not robust against outliers, meaning that very large or small data
  points can have a large effect on the output of the PCA.
* PCA assumes a linear relationship between variables which is not always a
  realistic assumption.
* It can be difficult to interpret the meaning of the principal components,
  especially when including them in further analyses (e.g. inclusion in a linear
  regression).

# Using PCA to analyse gene expression data 


##  A gene expression dataset of cancer patients

The dataset we will be analysing in this lesson includes two subsets of data: 
* a matrix of gene expression data showing microarray results for different
  probes used to examine gene expression profiles in 91 different breast
  cancer patient samples.
* metadata associated with the gene expression results detailing information
  from patients from whom samples were taken.

In this section, we will work through Challenges and you will apply your own PCA to the high-dimensional gene expression data using what we have learnt so far. 

We will first load the microarray breast cancer gene expression data and
associated metadata, downloaded from the
[Gene Expression Omnibus](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE2990).

```{r se}
library("SummarizedExperiment")
cancer <- readRDS(here("data/cancer_expression.rds"))
mat <- assay(cancer)
metadata <- colData(cancer)
```

```{r mat, eval=FALSE}
head(mat)
#nrow=22215 probes
#ncol=91 samples
```

```{r meta, eval=FALSE}
head(metadata)
#nrow=91
#ncol=8
```

```{r colnames}
all(colnames(mat) == rownames(metadata))
#Check that column names and row names match
#If they do should return TRUE
```


The 'mat' variable contains a matrix of gene expression profiles for each sample.
Rows represent gene expression measurements and columns represent samples. The
'metadata' variable contains the metadata associated with the gene expression
data including the name of the study from which data originate, the age of the
patient from which the sample was taken, whether or not an oestrogen receptor
was involved in their cancer and the grade and size of the cancer for each
sample (represented by rows).

Microarray data are difficult to analyse for several reasons. Firstly, 
formulating a research question using microarray data can be difficult,
especially if not much is known a priori
about which genes code for particular phenotypes of interest.
Secondly, they are typically high-dimensional and therefore are subject to the same
difficulties associated with analysing high-dimensional data. Finally,
exploratory analysis, which can be used to help formulate research questions
and display relationships, is difficult using microarray data due to the number
of potentially interesting response variables (i.e. expression data from probes
targeting different genes).

If researchers hypothesise that groups of genes (e.g. biological pathways) may
be associated with different phenotypic characteristics of cancers (e.g.
histologic grade, tumour size), using statistical methods that reduce the
number of columns in the microarray matrix to a smaller number of dimensions
representing groups of genes would help visualise the data and address
research questions regarding the effect different groups of genes have on
disease progression.

Using **`PCAtools`**, we will perform PCA on the cancer
gene expression data, plot the amount of variation in the data explained by
each principal component and plot the most important principal components
against each other as well as understanding what each principal component
represents.

## Choosing how many components are important to explain the variance in the data

As in the example using the `prostate` dataset, we can use a scree plot to
compare the proportion of variance in the data explained by each principal
component. This allows us to understand how much information in the microarray
dataset is lost by projecting the observations onto the first few principal
components and whether these principal components represent a reasonable
amount of the variation. The proportion of variance explained should sum to one.

## Investigating the principal components 

Once the most important principal components have been identified using
`screeplot()` and explored, these can be explored in more detail by plotting principal components
against each other and highlighting points based on variables in the metadata.
This will allow any potential clustering of points according to demographic or
phenotypic variables to be seen.

We can use biplots to look for patterns in the output from the PCA. Note that there
are two functions called `biplot()`, one in the package **`PCAtools`** and one in
**`stats`**. Both functions produce biplots but their scales are different!

Let's consider this biplot in more detail, and also display the loadings:

So far, we have only looked at a biplot of PC1 versus PC2 which only gives part
of the picture. The `pairplots()` function in **`PCAtools`** can be used to create
multiple biplots including different principal components.

```{r pairsplot, fig.cap="Multiple biplots produced by pairsplot().", fig.alt="An upper triangular grid of scatter plots of each principal component versus the others."}
pairsplot(pc)
```

The plots show two apparent clusters involving the first principal component
only. No other clusters are found involving other principal components. Each dot
is coloured differently along a gradient of blues. This can potentially help identifying
the same observation/individual in several panels. Here too, the argument `colby` allows
you to set custom colours.


Finally, it can sometimes be of interest to compare how certain variables contribute
to different principal components. This can be visualised with `plotloadings()` from
the **`PCAtools`** package. The function checks the range of loadings for each
principal component specified (default: first five principal components). It then selects the features
in the top and bottom 5% of these ranges and displays their loadings. This behaviour
can be adjusted with the `rangeRetain` argument, which has 0.1 as the default value (i.e.
5% on each end of the range). NB, if there are too many labels to be plotted, you will see
a warning. This is not a serious problem.

```{r loadingsplots, fig.cap=c("Plot of the features in the top and bottom 5 % of the loadings range for the first principal component.", "Plot of the features in the top and bottom 5 % of the loadings range for the second principal component.", fig.cap="Plot of the features in the top and bottom 5 % of the loadings range for the either the first or second principal components."), fig.alt=c("A plot with component loading versus principal component index. The plot shows the loadings of features at the top and bottom 5 % of the loadings range and only for the first principal component. The component loading values for four features are shown. The features with the highest loadings are shown at the top of the plot and consist of three features, each with a blue dot and feature label. The feature with the lowest loading is shown at the bottom of the plot and delineated by a yellow dot with a feature label.", "A plot with component loadings versus principal component index. The plot shows the loadings of features at the top and bottom 5 % of the loadings range and only for the second principal component. The component loading values for 9 features are shown. The features with the highest loadings are shown at the top of the plot and consist of 6 features, each with a blue dot and feature label. The 3 features at the lower range are at the bottom of the plot and delineated by a yellow dot with a feature label.", fig.alt="A plot with component loading versus principal component index. The plot shows the loadings of features at the top and bottom 5 % of the loadings range for either principal component. The component loading values for several features are shown with loading score-delineated colours ranging from dark blue for the highest loadings and dark yellow for the lowest loadings. Each point has a feature label. The loadings of features points for the first principal component are concentrated towards the top, while the loadings of features points for the second principal components are concentrated at the top, middle and bottom of the range.")}
plotloadings(pc, c("PC1"), rangeRetain = 0.1)
plotloadings(pc, c("PC2"), rangeRetain = 0.1)
plotloadings(pc, c("PC1", "PC2"), rangeRetain = 0.1)
```

You can see how the third code line produces more dots, some of which do not have
extreme loadings. This is because all loadings selected for any principal component
are shown for all other principal components. For instance, it is plausible that features which have high loadings on PC1 may have lower ones on PC2.


# Using PCA output in further analysis

The output of PCA can be used to interpret data or can be used in further
analyses. For example, the PCA outputs new variables (principal components)
which represent several variables in the original dataset. These new variables
are useful for further exploring data, for example, comparing principal
component scores between groups or including the new variables in linear
regressions. Because the principal components are uncorrelated (and independent)
they can be included together in a single linear regression.
