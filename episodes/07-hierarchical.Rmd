# Why use hierarchical clustering on high-dimensional data?

When analysing high-dimensional data in the life sciences, it is often useful
to identify groups of similar data points to understand more about the relationships
within the dataset. General clustering algorithms group similar
data points (or observations) into groups (or clusters). This results in a set
of clusters, where each cluster is distinct, and the data points within each
cluster have similar characteristics. The clustering algorithm works by iteratively
grouping data points so that different clusters may exist at different stages
of the algorithm's progression.

Here, we describe *hierarchical clustering*. Unlike K-means clustering, 
hierarchical clustering does not require the
number of clusters $k$ to be specified by the user before the analysis is carried
out. 

Hierarchical clustering also provides an attractive *dendrogram*, a
tree-like diagram showing the degree of similarity between clusters. 
The dendrogram is a key feature of hierarchical clustering. This tree-shaped graph allows
the similarity between data points in a dataset to be visualised and the
arrangement of clusters produced by the analysis to be illustrated. Dendrograms are created
using a distance (or dissimilarity) that quantify how different are pairs of observations,
and a clustering algorithm to fuse groups of similar data points together.

In this episode we will explore hierarchical clustering for identifying
clusters in high-dimensional data. We will use *agglomerative* hierarchical
clustering (see box) in this episode.

# The agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm 

To start with, we measure distance
(or dissimilarity) between pairs of observations. Initially, and at the bottom
of the dendrogram, each observation is considered to be in its own individual
cluster. We start the clustering procedure by fusing the two observations that
are most similar according to a distance matrix. Next, the next-most similar observations are fused
so that the total number of clusters is *number of observations* minus 2 (see
panel below). Groups of observations may then be merged into a larger cluster
(see next panel below, green box). This process continues until all the observations are included
in a single cluster.

```{r hclustfig1, echo=FALSE, out.width="500px", fig.cap="Figure 1a: Example data showing two clusters of observation pairs"}
knitr::include_graphics("../fig/hierarchical_clustering_1.png")
```


```{r hclustfig2, echo=FALSE, out.width="500px", fig.cap="Figure 1b: Example data showing fusing of one observation into larger cluster"}
knitr::include_graphics("../fig/hierarchical_clustering_2.png")
```

# A motivating example

To motivate this lesson, let's first look at an example where hierarchical
clustering is really useful, and then we can understand how to apply it in more
detail. To do this, we'll return to the large methylation dataset we worked
with in the regression lessons. Let's load the data and look at it.

```{r}
library("minfi")
library("here")
library("ComplexHeatmap")

methyl <- readRDS(here("data/methylation.rds"))

# transpose this Bioconductor dataset to show features in columns
methyl_mat <- t(assay(methyl))
```

```{r heatmap-noclust, echo=FALSE}

Heatmap(methyl_mat,
  name = "Methylation level",
  cluster_rows = FALSE, cluster_columns = FALSE,
  show_row_names = FALSE, show_column_names = FALSE,
  row_title="Individuals", column_title = "Methylation sites"
)
```

Looking at a heatmap of these data, we may spot some patterns -- looking at the
vertical stripes, many columns
appear to have a similar methylation levels across all rows. However, they are
all quite jumbled at the moment, so it's hard to tell how many line up exactly.

We can order these data to make the patterns more clear using hierarchical
clustering. To do this, we can change the arguments we pass to 
`Heatmap()` from the **`ComplexHeatmap`** package. `Heatmap()`
groups features based on dissimilarity (here, Euclidean distance) and orders
rows and columns to show clustering of features and observations.

```{r heatmap-clust}
Heatmap(methyl_mat,
  name = "Methylation level",
  cluster_rows = TRUE, cluster_columns = TRUE,
  row_dend_width = unit(0.2, "npc"),
  column_dend_height = unit(0.2, "npc"),
  show_row_names = FALSE, show_column_names = FALSE,
  row_title="Individuals", column_title = "Methylation sites"
)
```

We can see that clustering the features (CpG sites) results in an overall
gradient of high to low methylation levels from left to right. Maybe more
interesting is the fact that the rows (corresponding to individuals) are now
grouped according to methylation patterns. For example, 12 samples seem to have
lower methylation levels for a small subset of CpG sites in the middle, relative
to all the other samples. It's not clear without investigating further what the
cause of this is -- it could be a batch effect, or a known grouping (e.g., old
vs young samples). However, clustering like this can be a useful part of
exploratory analysis of data to build hypotheses.

Now, let's cover the inner workings of hierarchical clustering in more detail.
There are two things to consider before carrying out clustering:
* how to define dissimilarity between observations using a distance matrix, and
* how to define dissimilarity between clusters and when to fuse separate clusters.

# Creating the distance matrix
Agglomerative hierarchical clustering is performed in two steps: calculating
the distance matrix (containing distances between pairs of observations) and
iteratively grouping observations into clusters using this matrix.

There are different ways to
specify a distance matrix for clustering:

* Specify distance as a pre-defined option using the `method` argument in
  `dist()`. Methods include `euclidean` (default), `maximum` and `manhattan`.
* Create a self-defined function which calculates distance from a matrix or
  from two vectors. The function should only contain one argument.

Of pre-defined methods of calculating the distance matrix, Euclidean is one of
the most commonly used. This method calculates the shortest straight-line
distances between pairs of observations.

Another option is to use a correlation matrix as the input matrix to the
clustering algorithm. The type of distance matrix used in hierarchical
clustering can have a big effect on the resulting tree. The decision of which
distance matrix to use before carrying out hierarchical clustering depends on the
type of data and question to be addressed. 

# Linkage methods

The second step in performing hierarchical clustering after defining the
distance matrix (or another function defining similarity between data points)
is determining how to fuse different clusters.

*Linkage* is used to define dissimilarity between groups of observations
(or clusters) and is used to create the hierarchical structure in the
dendrogram. Different linkage methods of creating a dendrogram are discussed
below.

`hclust()` supports various linkage methods (e.g `complete`,
`single`, `ward D`, `ward D2`, `average`, `median`) and these are also supported
within the `Heatmap()` function. The method used to perform hierarchical
clustering in `Heatmap()` can be specified by the arguments
`clustering_method_rows` and `clustering_method_columns`. Each linkage method
uses a slightly different algorithm to calculate how clusters are fused together
and therefore different clustering decisions are made depending on the linkage
method used.

Complete linkage (the default in `hclust()`) works by computing all pairwise
dissimilarities between data points in different clusters. For each pair of two clusters,
it sets their dissimilarity ($d$) to the maximum dissimilarity value observed
between any of these clusters' constituent points. The two clusters
with smallest value of $d$ are then fused.

# Computing a dendrogram

Dendograms are useful tools to visualise the grouping of points and clusters into bigger clusters.
We can create and plot dendrograms in R using `hclust()` which takes
a distance matrix as input and creates the associated tree using hierarchical
clustering. Here we create some example data to carry out hierarchical
clustering. 

Let's generate 20 data points in 2D space. Each
point belongs to one of three classes. Suppose we did not know which class
data points belonged to and we want to identify these via cluster analysis.
Hierarchical clustering carried out on the data can be used to produce a
dendrogram showing how the data is partitioned into clusters. But how do we
interpret this dendrogram? Let's explore this using our example data.


```{r plotexample}
#First, create some example data with two variables x1 and x2
set.seed(450)
example_data <- data.frame(
    x1 = rnorm(20, 8, 4.5),
    x2 = rnorm(20, 6, 3.4)
)

#plot the data and name data points by row numbers
plot(example_data$x1, example_data$x2, type = "n")
text(
    example_data$x1,
    example_data$x2,
    labels = rownames(example_data),
    cex = 0.7
)

## calculate distance matrix using euclidean distance
dist_m <- dist(example_data, method = "euclidean")
```

This dendrogram shows similarities/differences in distances between data points.
Each leaf of the dendrogram represents one of the 20 data points. These leaves
fuse into branches as the height increases. Observations that are similar fuse into
the same branches. The height at which any two
data points fuse indicates how different these two points are. Points that fuse
at the top of the tree are very different from each other compared with two
points that fuse at the bottom of the tree, which are quite similar. You can
see this by comparing the position of similar/dissimilar points according to
the scatterplot with their position on the tree.

# Identifying clusters based on the dendrogram 

To do this, we can make a horizontal cut through the dendrogram at a user-defined height. 
The sets of observations beneath this cut can be thought of as distinct clusters. For
example, a cut at height 10 produces two downstream clusters while a cut at
height 4 produces six downstream clusters.

We can cut the dendrogram to determine number of clusters at different heights
using `cutree()`. This function cuts a dendrogram into several
groups (or clusters) where the number of desired groups is controlled by the
user, by defining either `k` (number of groups) or `h` (height at which tree is
cut).

```{r cutree}
## k is a user defined parameter determining
## the desired number of clusters at which to cut the treee
cutree(clust, k = 3)
## h is a user defined parameter determining
## the numeric height at which to cut the tree
cutree(clust, h = 10)
## both give same results 

four_cut <- cutree(clust, h = 4)

## we can produce the cluster each observation belongs to
## using the mutate and count functions
library(dplyr)
example_cl <- mutate(example_data, cluster = four_cut)
count(example_cl, cluster)

#plot cluster each point belongs to on original scatterplot
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(example_cl, aes(x = x2, y = x1, color = factor(cluster))) + geom_point()
```

Note that this cut produces 8 clusters (two before the cut and another six
downstream of the cut).

# Highlighting dendrogram branches

In addition to visualising cluster identity in scatter plots, it is also possible to
highlight branches in dentrograms. In this example, we calculate a distance matrix between
samples in the `methyl_mat` dataset. We then draw boxes round clusters obtained with `cutree`.

```{r plot-clust-method}
## create a distance matrix using euclidean method
distmat <- dist(methyl_mat)
## hierarchical clustering using complete method
clust <- hclust(distmat)
## plot resulting dendrogram
plot(clust)

## draw border around three clusters
rect.hclust(clust, k = 3, border = 2:6)
## draw border around two clusters
rect.hclust(clust, k = 2, border = 2:6)
```
We can also colour clusters downstream of a specified cut using `color_branches()`
from the **`dendextend`** package.

```{r plot-coloured-branches}
## cut tree at height = 4
cut <- cutree(clust, h = 50)

library("dendextend")
avg_dend_obj <- as.dendrogram(clust)      
## colour branches of dendrogram depending on clusters
plot(color_branches(avg_dend_obj, h = 50))
```

# The effect of different linkage methods
Now let us look into changing the default behaviour of `hclust()`. Imagine we have two crescent-shaped point clouds as shown below.
```{r crescents}
# These two functions are to help us make crescents. Don't worry it you do not understand all this code.
# The importent bit is the object "cres", which consists of two columns (x and y coordinates of two crescents).
is.insideCircle <- function(co, r=0.5, offs=c(0,0)){
  sqrt((co[,1]+offs[1])^2 + (co[,2]+offs[2])^2) <= r
}
make.crescent <- function(n){
  raw <- cbind(x=runif(n)-0.5, y=runif(n)-0.5)
  raw[is.insideCircle(raw) & !is.insideCircle(raw, offs=c(0, -0.2)),]
}
# make x/y data in shape of two crescents
set.seed(123)
cres1 <- make.crescent(1000) # 1st crescent
cres2 <- make.crescent(1000) # 2nd crescent
cres2[,2] <- -cres2[,2] -0.1 # flip 2nd crescent upside-down and shift down
cres2[,1] <- cres2[,1] + 0.5 # shift second crescent to the right

cres <- rbind(cres1, cres2) # concatente x/y values
plot(cres)
```
We might expect that the crescents are resolved into separate clusters. But if we
run hierarchical clustering with the default arguments, we get this:

```{r cresClustDefault}
cresClass <- cutree(hclust(dist(cres)), k=2) # save partition for colouring
plot(cres, col=cresClass) # colour scatterplot by partition
```

The help page of `hclust()` gives some intuition on linkage methods. It describes `complete`
(the default) and `single` as opposite ends of a spectrum with all other methods in between.
When using complete linkage, the distance between two clusters is assumed to be the distance
between both clusters' most distant points. This opposite it true for single linkage, where
the minimum distance between any two points, one from each of two clusters is used. Single
linkage is described as friends-of-friends appporach - and really, it groups all close-together
points into the same cluster (thus resolving one cluster per crescent). Complete linkage on the
other hand recognises that some points a the tip of a crescent are much closer to points in the
other crescent and so it splits both crescents.

# Using different distance methods

So far, we've been using Euclidean distance to define the dissimilarity
or distance between observations. However, this isn't always the best
metric for how dissimilar different observations are. Let's make an
example to demonstrate. Here, we're creating two samples each with
ten observations of random noise:

```{r create-cor-example}
set.seed(20)
cor_example <- data.frame(
  sample_a = rnorm(10),
  sample_b = rnorm(10)
)
rownames(cor_example) <- paste(
  "Feature", 1:nrow(cor_example)
)
```

Now, let's create a new sample that has exactly the same pattern across all
our features as `sample_a`, just offset by 5:

```{r sample-c}
cor_example$sample_c <- cor_example$sample_a + 5
```

You can see that this is a lot like the `assay()` of our methylation object
from earlier, where columns are observations or samples, and rows are features:

```{r head-cor-example}
head(cor_example)
```

If we plot a heatmap of this, we can see that `sample_a` and `sample_b` are
grouped together because they have a small distance to each other, despite
being quite different in their pattern across the different features.
In contrast, `sample_a` and `sample_c` are very distant, despite having
*exactly* the same pattern across the different features.

```{r heatmap-cor-example}
Heatmap(as.matrix(cor_example))
```

We can see that more clearly if we do a line plot:
```{r lineplot-cor-example}
## create a blank plot (type = "n" means don't draw anything)
## with an x range to hold the number of features we have.
## the range of y needs to be enough to show all the values for every feature
plot(
  1:nrow(cor_example),
  rep(range(cor_example), 5),
  type = "n"
)
## draw a red line for sample_a
lines(cor_example$sample_a, col = "firebrick")
## draw a blue line for sample_b
lines(cor_example$sample_b, col = "dodgerblue")
## draw a green line for sample_c
lines(cor_example$sample_c, col = "forestgreen")
```

We can see that `sample_a` and `sample_c` have exactly the same pattern across
all of the different features. However, due to the overall difference between
the values, they have a high distance to each other.
We can see that if we cluster and plot the data ourselves using Euclidean
distance:

```{r clust-euc-cor-example}
clust_dist <- hclust(dist(t(cor_example)))
plot(clust_dist)
```

In some cases, we might want to ensure that samples that have similar patterns,
whether that be of gene expression, or DNA methylation, have small distances
to each other. Correlation is a measure of this kind of similarity in pattern.
However, high correlations indicate similarity, while for a distance measure
we know that high distances indicate dissimilarity. Therefore, if we wanted
to cluster observations based on the correlation, or the similarity of patterns,
we can use `1 - cor(x)` as the distance metric.
The input to `hclust()` must be a `dist` object, so we also need to call
`as.dist()` on it before passing it in.

```{r clust-cor-cor-example}
cor_as_dist <- as.dist(1 - cor(cor_example))
clust_cor <- hclust(cor_as_dist)
plot(clust_cor)
```

Now, `sample_a` and `sample_c` that have identical patterns across the features
are grouped together, while `sample_b` is seen as distant because it has a
different pattern, even though its values are closer to `sample_a`.
Using your own distance function is often useful, especially if you have missing
or unusual data. It's often possible to use correlation and other custom
distance functions to functions that perform hierarchical clustering, such as
`pheatmap()` and `stats::heatmap()`:

```{r heatmap-cor-cor-example}
## pheatmap allows you to select correlation directly
pheatmap(as.matrix(cor_example), clustering_distance_cols = "correlation")
## Using the built-in stats::heatmap 
heatmap(
  as.matrix(cor_example),
  distfun = function(x) as.dist(1 - cor(t(x)))
)
```


# Validating clusters

Now that we know how to carry out hierarchical clustering, how do we know how
many clusters are optimal for the dataset?

Hierarchical clustering carried out on any dataset will produce clusters,
even when there are no 'real' clusters in the data! We need to be able to
determine whether identified clusters represent true groups in the data, or
whether clusters have been identified just due to chance. In the last episode,
we have introduced silhouette scores as a measure of cluster compactness and
bootstrapping to assess cluster robustness. Such tests can be used to compare
different clustering algorithms, for example, those fitted using different linkage
methods. 

Here, we introduce the Dunn index, which is a measure of cluster compactness. The
Dunn index is the ratio of the smallest distance between any two clusters
and to the largest intra-cluster distance found within any cluster. This can be 
seen as a family of indices which differ depending on the method used to compute
distances. The Dunn index is a metric that penalises clusters that have
larger intra-cluster variance and smaller inter-cluster variance. The higher the
Dunn index, the better defined the clusters.

Let's calculate the Dunn index for clustering carried out on the
`methyl_mat` dataset using the **`clValid`** package.

```{r plot-clust-dunn}
## calculate dunn index
## (ratio of the smallest distance between obs not in the same cluster
## to the largest intra-cluster distance)
library("clValid")
## calculate euclidean distance between points 
distmat <- dist(methyl_mat)  
clust <- hclust(distmat, method = "complete")
plot(clust)

cut <- cutree(clust, h = 50)

## retrieve Dunn's index for given matrix and clusters
dunn(distance = distmat, cut)
```

The value of the Dunn index has no meaning in itself, but is used to compare
between sets of clusters with larger values being preferred.

The figures below show in a more systematic way how changing the values of `k` and
`h` using `cutree()` affect the Dunn index.

```{r hclust-fig3, echo=TRUE, fig.cap="Figure 3: Dunn index"}
h_seq <- 70:10
h_dunn <- sapply(h_seq, function(x) dunn(distance = distmat, cutree(clust, h = x)))
k_seq <- seq(2, 10)
k_dunn <- sapply(k_seq, function(x) dunn(distance = distmat, cutree(clust, k = x)))
plot(h_seq, h_dunn, xlab = "Height (h)", ylab = "Dunn index")
grid()
```
You can see that at low values of `h`, the Dunn index can be high. But this
is not very useful - cutting the given tree at a low `h` value like 15 leads to allmost all observations
ending up each in its own cluster. More relevant is the second maximum in the plot, around `h=55`.
Looking at the dendrogram, this corresponds to `k=4`.

```{r hclust-fig4, echo=TRUE, fig.cap="Figure 4: Dunn index continued"}
plot(k_seq, k_dunn, xlab = "Number of clusters (k)", ylab = "Dunn index")
grid()
```
For the given range of `k` values explored, we obtain the highest Dunn index with `k=4`.
This is in agreement with the previous plot.

There have been criticisms of the use of the Dunn index in validating
clustering results, due to its high sensitivity to noise in the dataset.
An alternative is to use silhouette scores (see the k-means clustering episode).

As we said before (see previous episode), clustering is a non-trivial task.
It is important to think about the nature of your data and your expactations
rather than blindly using a some algorithm for clustering or cluster validation.
