# Problem statement

In high-throughput studies, it's common to have one or more 
phenotypes or groupings that we want to relate to features of 
interest (eg, gene expression, DNA methylation levels).
In general, we want to identify differences in the 
features of interest
that are related to a phenotype or grouping of our samples.
Identifying features of interest that vary along with
phenotypes or groupings can allow us to understand how
phenotypes arise or manifest.

For example, we might want to identify genes that are
expressed at a higher level in mutant mice relative
to wild-type mice to understand the effect
of a mutation on cellular phenotypes.
Alternatively, we might have
samples from a set of patients, and wish to identify
epigenetic features that are different in young patients
relative to old patients, to help us understand how aging
manifests.

Using linear regression, it's possible to identify differences
like these . However, high-dimensional data like the ones we're
working with require some special considerations.

Ideally, we want to identify cases like this, where there is a
clear difference, and we probably "don't need" statistics:

```{r example1, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="A scatter plot of age and a feature of interest.", fig.alt="An example of a strong linear association between a continuous phenotype (age) on the x-axis and a feature of interest (gene expression for a given gene) on the y-axis. A strong linear relationship with a positive slope exists between the two.", fig.width=6, fig.height=6}
library("ggplot2")
theme_set(theme_bw())
set.seed(42)
n <- 10
x <- c(rnorm(n, 0), rnorm(n, 3))
group <- (2 * x) + rnorm(n)
ggplot() +
    aes(x = group, y = x) +
    geom_point() +
    labs(x = "Age", y = "Gene expression")
```

or equivalently for a discrete covariate:

```{r example2, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="A scatter plot of a grouping and a feature of interest.", fig.alt="An example of a strong linear association between a discrete phenotype (group) on the x-axis and a feature of interest (gene expression for a given gene) on the y-axis. The two groups clearly differ with respect to gene expression.", fig.width=6, fig.height=6}
library("ggplot2")
set.seed(42)
n <- 10
x <- c(rnorm(n, 0), rnorm(n, 5))
group <- c(rep("A", n), rep("B", n))
ggplot() +
    aes(x = group, y = x, colour = group) +
    # geom_violin() +
    # geom_boxplot(width = 0.25) +
    geom_jitter(height = 0, width = 0.2) +
    labs(y = "Gene expression")
```

However, often due to small differences and small sample sizes,
the problem is a bit more difficult:
```{r example3, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="A scatter plot of a grouping and a feature of interest.", fig.alt="An example of a strong linear association between a discrete phenotype (group) on the x-axis and a feature of interest (gene expression for a given gene) on the y-axis. The two groups seem to differ with respect to gene expression, but the relationship is weak.", fig.width=6, fig.height=6}
library("ggplot2")
set.seed(66)
n <- 5
x <- c(rnorm(n, 0), rnorm(n, 1))
group <- c(rep("A", n), rep("B", n))
ggplot() +
    aes(x = group, y = x, colour = group) +
    # geom_violin() +
    # geom_boxplot(width = 0.25) +
    geom_jitter(height = 0, width = 0.2) +
    labs(y = "Gene expression")
```

And, of course, we often have an awful lot of features and need
to prioritise a subset of them! We need a rigorous way to
prioritise genes for further analysis.

# Linear regression (recap)

Linear regression is a tool we can use to quantify the relationship
between two variables. With one predictor variable $x$,
it amounts to the following equation:

$$
    y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \epsilon_i
$$

where $\epsilon_i$ is the *noise*, or the variation in $y$ that isn't explained
by the relationship we're modelling. We assume this noise follows a normal
distribution[^1], that is:

$$
    \epsilon_i \sim N(0, \sigma^2)
$$

We can also write this using linear algebra (matrices and vectors) as follows: 

$$
    y = X\beta + \epsilon
$$

Another way of saying this is that y follows a normal distribution with

$$
    y \sim N(X\beta, \sigma^2)
$$

Or, visually, that (for example) this is the distribution 
of new points conditional on their $x$ values:

```{r conditionalprob, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Regression is like a normal distribution with varying mean.", fig.alt="The generative model of a simple linear regression with a fixed slope and intercept. Lightly shaded regions represent regions where observations are probable, and darker regions represent lower probability."}
set.seed(42)
x <- cbind(rep(1, 100), rnorm(100))
beta <- rnorm(2)
sx <- seq(min(x), max(x), length.out = 200)
sy <- seq(min(x), max(x), length.out = 200)
fx <- cbind(rep(1, 200), sx) %*% beta

dens <- matrix(NA, 200, 200)
for (i in seq_along(sx)) {
    for (j in seq_along(sy)) {
        dens[i, j] <- dnorm(sy[[j]], mean = fx[[i]])
    }
}
image(sx, sy, dens,
    col = viridis::viridis(100, option = "magma"),
    xlab = "x", ylab = "y"
)
```

In order to decide whether a result would be unlikely
under the null hypothesis, we can calculate a test statistic.
For coefficient $j$ in a linear model, the test statistic is
a t-statistic given by:

$$
    t_{j} = \frac{\hat{\beta}_{j}}{SE\left(\hat{\beta}_{j}\right)}
$$

$SE\left(\hat{\beta}_{j}\right)$ measures the uncertainty we have in our effect
size estimate.

Knowing what distribution these t-values follow under the null
hypothesis allows us to determine how unlikely it would be for
us to observe what we have under those circumstances (the basis
of null hypothesis significance testing).

To demonstrate, we can manually demonstrate the relationship between these
quantities (this is not important to remember).
```{r simfit}
x <- rnorm(100)
y <- rnorm(100)
fit <- lm(y ~ x)
tab <- as.data.frame(summary(fit)$coef)
tab
```

We can see that the t-statistic is just the ratio of the estimate to the 
standard error:

```{r simtval}
tvals <- tab$Estimate / tab$Std
all.equal(tvals, tab$t)
```

Calculating the p-values is a bit more tricky.
We want to do a 2-tail test, so we take the absolute value of the t-statistic,
and look at the upper rather than lower tail. Because in a 2-tail test we're
looking at "half" of the t-distribution, we also multiply the p-value by 2.

```{r simpval}
pvals <- 2 * pt(abs(tvals), df = fit$df, lower.tail = FALSE)
all.equal(tab$Pr, pvals)
```

This is much more easy to observe visually, by plotting the distribution:

```{r tdist, echo = FALSE, fig.cap="The p-value for a regression coefficient represents how often it'd be observed under the null.", fig.alt="Density plot of a t-distribution showing the observed test statistics (here, t-statistics). The p-values, visualised here with shaded regions, represent the portion of the null distribution that is as extreme or more extreme as the observed test statistics, which are shown as dashed lines."}

    geom_function(fun = function(x) dt(x, df = fit$df)) +
    xlim(0, 4) +
    geom_vline(
        aes(xintercept = abs(tvals), color = rownames(tab)),
        lty = "dashed"
    ) +

    ) +

        geom = "area"
    ) +
    scale_color_discrete("Parameter", aesthetics = c("fill", "colour")) +
    labs(x = "Density", y = "t-statistic")
```

# Data

For the following few episodes, we'll be working with human
DNA methylation data from flow-sorted blood samples.
DNA methylation assays measure, for many sites in the genome,
the proportion of DNA that carries a methyl mark.

In this case, the methylation data come in the form of a matrix
of normalised methylation levels (M-values, for the technical among
you). Along with this, we have a number of sample phenotypes
(eg, age in years, BMI).

The following code will read in the data for this episode.

```{r loadmethy}
library("here")
library("minfi")
methylation <- readRDS(here("data/methylation.rds"))
```

This `methylation` object is a `GenomicRatioSet`, a Bioconductor data object
derived from the `SummarizedExperiment` class.
These `SummarizedExperiment` objects contain `assay`s, in this case methylation
levels, and optional sample-level `colData` and feature-level `metadata`.
These objects are very convenient to contain all of the information about 
a dataset in a high-throughput context and may be covered in more
detail in other Carpentries lessons.

```{r showmethy}
methylation
```

To extract the matrix of methylation values, we use the `assay` function.
One thing to bear in mind with these objects (and data 
structures for computational biology in R generally) is that
in the matrix of methylation data, samples or observations
are stored as columns, while features (in this case, CpG sites)
are stored as rows. This is in contrast to usual tabular data,
where features or variables are stored as columns and 
observations are stored as rows.

```{r grabx}
methyl_mat <- assay(methylation)
```

The distribution of these M-values looks like this:

```{r histx, fig.cap="Methylation levels are generally bimodally distributed.", fig.alt="Histogram of M-values for all features. The distribution appears to be bimodal, with a large number of unmethylated features as well as many methylated features, and many intermediate features."}
hist(methyl_mat, breaks = "FD", xlab = "M-value")
```

In this case, the phenotypes and groupings in the `colData` 
look like this for the first 6 samples:

```{r datatable, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(head(colData(methylation)), row.names = FALSE)
```

In this case, we will focus on age. The association between
age and methylation status in blood samples has been studied extensively,
and is actually a good case-study in how to perform some of the techniques
we will cover in this lesson. The methylation levels for these data 
can be presented in a heatmap:

```{r heatmap, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Visualising the data as a heatmap, it's clear that there's too many models to fit 'by hand'.", fig.alt="Heatmap of methylation values across all features. Samples are ordered according to age."}
age <- methylation$Age

library("ComplexHeatmap")
order <- order(age)
age_ord <- age[order]
methyl_mat_ord <- methyl_mat[, order]
Heatmap(methyl_mat_ord,
    cluster_columns = FALSE,
    # cluster_rows = FALSE,
    name = "M-value",
    col = RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(10, "RdYlBu"),
    top_annotation = columnAnnotation(
        age = age_ord
    ),
    show_row_names = FALSE,
    show_column_names = FALSE,
    row_title = "Feature",
    column_title =  "Sample",
    use_raster = FALSE
)
```

We would like to identify features that are related to our outcome of interest
(age). It's clear from the heatmap that there are too many features to do so
manually, even with this reduced number of features - the original dataset
contained over 800,000!

# Running linear regression

We have a matrix of methylation values $X$ and a vector of ages, $y$.
One way to model this is to see if we can "predict" methylation using age.
Formally we'd describe that as:

$$
    X_{i,j} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 y_j + \epsilon_i
$$
where $y_j$ is the age of sample $j$.

You may remember how to fit this model from a previous lesson, and how to
get more information from the model object:

```{r fit1}
fit <- lm(methyl_mat[1, ] ~ age)
summary(fit)
```

We can also use `broom` to extract information about
the coefficients in this model:

```{r tidyfit}
library("broom")
tidy(fit)
```

The first coefficient in this model is the intercept, measuring the overall 
offset between age and methylation levels. In this instance, we're more 
interested if there is a relationship between increasing age and methylation
levels. Therefore, we'll focus only on the second coefficient.
We'll also convert these objects from a `tibble` to a normal `data.frame`.

```{r tidyfit2}
coef1 <- as.data.frame(tidy(fit)[2, ])
coef1
```

We can write a function to fit this kind of model for any given row of the
matrix, and then use it to fit a model to any feature we like:

```{r fitfunction}
lm_feature <- function(i) {
    as.data.frame(tidy(lm(methyl_mat[i, ] ~ age))[2, ])
}
coef2 <- lm_feature(2)
coef3 <- lm_feature(3)
```


We have a lot of features, though! Instead of looping through these values,
we can `lapply` over the number of rows of the matrix to fit a model for each
feature.

```{r lapplyfitfun}
dfs <- lapply(seq_len(nrow(methyl_mat)), lm_feature)
head(dfs)
```

Now we have a list of coefficients, standard errors, and associated p-values
for each of the rows of our matrix, we can `rbind` them together.
To do this with each of the elements of our list, we can use `do.call`.
This calls the function supplied as the first argument (here, `rbind`) using
the second argument as a list of arguments to that function.
Here, it's equivalent to writing `rbind(dfs[[1]], dfs[[2]], [etc])`.

```{r rbindfits}
## bind together all of our small tables to make one big table
df_all <- do.call(rbind, dfs)
## set the rownames of the table to be the names of the features
rownames(df_all) <- rownames(methyl_mat)
```

We can then create a plot of effect size estimates (model coefficients) against
p-values for each of these figures, to visualise the magnitude of effects.
It's worth noting here that many p-values are very small (high on the y-axis)
despite the small effect size estimates. This is because, as we noted above, 
a p-value in this case is a function of both the effect size estimate and
the associated uncertainty.
These plots are often called "volcano plots", because they
resemble an eruption.

```{r volcplot1, fig.cap="Plotting significance against effect size, it's clear that the two are related (but not 1-1).", fig.alt="Plot of -log10(p) against effect size estimates for a regression of age against methylation level for each feature in the data."}
plot(df_all$estimate, -log10(df_all$p.value),
    xlab = "Effect size", ylab = bquote(-log[10](p)),
    pch = 19
)
```

In this figure, every point represents a feature of interest. The x-axis
represents the effect size observed for that feature in a linear model,
while the y-axis is the $-\log_{10}(\text{p})$, where larger values
indicate increasing statistical evidence of a non-zero effect size. 

Given that we often use procedures like this to identify differentially
methylated features or differentially expressed genes, we can imagine that
in an ideal case there would be clear separation between "null" and "non-null"
features. However, usually we observe results as we did here: there is a continuum
of effect sizes and p-values, with no clear. While statistical methods exist to
derive insights from continuous measure like these, it is often convenient to obtain
a list of features which we are confident have non-zero effect sizes.
This is made more difficult by the number of tests we perform.


# The problem of multiple tests

With such a large number of features, we often want some way
to decide which features are "interesting" or "significant"
for further study. However, if we were to apply a normal significance threshold
of 0.05, we might not end up 
To demonstrate this, it's useful to consider what happens if
we scramble age and run the same test again:

```{r volcplotfake, fig.cap="Plotting p-values against effect sizes for a randomised outcome shows we still observe 'significant' results.", fig.alt="Plot of -log10(p) against effect size estimates for a regression of a made-up feature against methylation level for each feature in the data. A dashed line represents a 0.05 significance level.", test="foo"}
age_perm <- age[sample(ncol(methyl_mat), ncol(methyl_mat))]
dfs <- lapply(seq_len(nrow(methyl_mat)), lm_feature)
df_all_perm <- do.call(rbind, dfs)
plot(df_all_perm$estimate, -log10(df_all_perm$p.value),
    xlab = "Effect size", ylab = bquote(-log[10](p)),
    pch = 19
)
abline(h = -log10(0.05), lty = "dashed")
```

# Adjusting for multiple comparisons

When performing many statistical tests to
categorise features, we're effectively classifying
features.

We can think of these features as being 
"truly different" or "not truly different"[^2].
Using this idea, we can see that each 
categorisation we make falls into four categories:

|              |Predicted true|Predicted false|
|-------------:|-------------:|--------------:|
|Actually true |True positive |False negative |
|Actually false|False positive|True negative  |

Under the null hypothesis, as we perform more and more
tests we'll tend to correctly categorise most
results as negative. However, since p-values
are uniformly distributed under the null,
at a significance level of 5%, 5% of all
results will be "significant" even though
these are results we expect under the null.
These can be considered "false discoveries."

There are two common ways of controlling these
false discoveries.

The first is to say that
we want to have the same certainty of making
one false discovery with $n$ tests as we had with
one. This is "Bonferroni" correction,[^3] which
divides the significance level by the number of
tests performed. Equivalently, we can use the
non-transformed p-value threshold but multiply
our p-values by the number of tests.
This is often very conservative, especially
with a lot of features!

```{r p-fwer, fig.cap="Bonferroni correction often produces very large p-values, especially with low sample sizes.", fig.alt="Plot of Bonferroni-adjusted p-values (y) against unadjusted p-values (x). A dashed black line represents the identity (where x=y), while dashed red lines represent 0.05 significance thresholds."}
p_raw <- df_all$p.value
p_fwer <- p.adjust(p_raw, method = "bonferroni")
library("ggplot2")
ggplot() +
    aes(p_raw, p_fwer) +
    geom_point() +
    scale_x_log10() + scale_y_log10() +
    geom_abline(slope = 1, linetype = "dashed") +
    geom_hline(yintercept = 0.05, lty = "dashed", col = "red") +
    geom_vline(xintercept = 0.05, lty = "dashed", col = "red") +
    labs(x = "Raw p-value", y = "Bonferroni p-value")
```


The second main way of controlling for multiple tests
is to control the *false discovery rate*.[^4]
This is the proportion of false discoveries
we'd expect to get each time if we repeated
the experiment over and over.

1. Rank the p-values
2. Assign each a rank (1 is smallest)
3. Calculate the critical value 
    $$
        q = \left(\frac{i}{m}\right)Q
    $$,
    where $i$ is rank, $m$ is the number of tests, and $Q$ is the
    false discovery rate we want to target.[^5]
4. Find the largest p-value less than the critical value.
    All smaller than this are significant.


|FWER|FDR|
|-------------:|--------------:|
|+ Controls probability of identifying a false positive|+ Controls rate of false discoveries|
|+ Strict error rate control |+ Allows error control with less stringency|
|- Often results in no significant results |- Does not control probability of making errors|
|- Requires larger statistical power|- May result in false discoveries|

# Sharing information

One idea is to take advantage of the fact that we're doing all these tests 
at once. We can leverage this fact to *share information* between model
parameters. 

The insight that we use to perform *information pooling* like this is that variance parameters
like these are probably similar between genes within the same experiment. This
enables us to share information between genes to get more robust
estimators.

Specifically, recall that the t-statistic for feature $i$, coefficient $j$ $\beta$ 
in a linear model is as follows:

$$
    t_{ij} = \frac{\hat{\beta}_{ij}}{SE\left(\hat{\beta}_{ij}\right)}
$$

It's clear that large effect sizes will likely lead to small p-values,
as long as the standard error for the coefficent is not large.
However, the standard error is affected by the strength of noise, 
as we saw earlier.
With small numbers of replicates, it's common for the noise for some features to
be extremely small simply by chance, leading to an inflated level of significance.
The authors of `limma` made some assumptions about the distributions that these
follow, and pool information across genes to get a better estimate of the uncertainty
in effect size estimates.


```{r limmavolc1, fig.cap="Plotting p-values against effect sizes using limma; the results are similar to a standard linear model.", fig.alt="A plot of -log10(p) against effect size estimates for a regression of age against methylation using limma."}
library("limma")

design <- model.matrix(~age)
fit_age <- lmFit(methyl_mat, design = design)
fit_age <- eBayes(fit_age)
toptab_age <- topTable(fit_age, coef = 2, number = nrow(fit_age))
plot(toptab_age$logFC, -log10(toptab_age$P.Value),
    xlab = "Effect size", ylab = bquote(-log[10](p)),
    pch = 19
)
```

```{r qval, echo = FALSE, eval=FALSE}
q <- qvalue(toptab_age$P.Value)
hist(q)
```

You can see that the effect of pooling is to shrink large 
estimates downwards and small estimates upwards, all towards
a common value. The degree of shrinkage generally depends on 
the amount of pooled information and the strength of the 
evidence independent of pooling.

Similarly, DESeq2 shares information between genes
to *shrink* estimates of a noise parameter, in that case to model counts.

Shrinkage methods can be complex to implement and understand,
but it's good to understand why these approaches may be more precise 
and sensitive than the naive approach of fitting a model to each feature
separately.

# Screening

What people sometimes do is to select variables based on correlation with
the outcome, or using a univariate modelling approach like we used in the 
previous lesson.
The p-values we get out of this kind of approach
model are meaningless because we're basically doing a 2-stage model and only
reporting one set of p-values (ignoring all the non-significant ones) and
not correctly adjusting for the true number of tests we're performing.

```{r screening-cor, fig.width=10, fig.cap="Caption", fig.alt="Alt"}
cors <- apply(methyl_mat, 1, function(col) cor(col, age))
x_cor <- methyl_mat[abs(cors) > quantile(abs(cors), 0.95), ]
design <- model.matrix(~age)
fit_cor <- lmFit(x_cor, design = design)
fit_cor <- eBayes(fit_cor)
toptab_cor <- topTable(fit_cor, coef = 2, number = nrow(fit_cor))
par(mfrow=c(1, 2))
plot(toptab_cor$logFC, -log10(toptab_cor$P.Value),
    xlab = "Effect size", ylab = bquote(-log[10](p)),
    pch = 19
)
feats <- rownames(toptab_cor)
pvals_both <- cbind(
    Original = toptab_age[feats, "adj.P.Val"],
    Screened = toptab_cor[feats, "adj.P.Val"]
)
lims <- range(pvals_both)
plot(pvals_both, pch = 19, xlim = lims, ylim = lims, log = "xy")
abline(h = 0.05, lty = "dashed", col = "firebrick")
abline(v = 0.05, lty = "dashed", col = "firebrick")
abline(coef = 0:1, lty = "dashed")
```

This two-step selection process biases the results towards
significance, and it means that the p-values we
report aren't accurate.

[^1]: It's not hugely problematic if the assumption of normal residuals is violated. It mainly affects our ability to accurately predict responses for new, unseen observations.

[^2]: "True difference" is a hard category to rigidly define. As we've seen, with a lot of data, we can detect tiny differences, and with little data, we can't detect large differences. However, both can be argued to be "true".

[^3]: Bonferroni correction is also termed "family-wise" error rate control.

[^4]: This is often called "Benjamini-Hochberg" adjustment.

[^5]: People often perform extra controls on FDR-adjusted p-values, ensuring that ranks don't change and the critical value is never smaller than the original p-value.
