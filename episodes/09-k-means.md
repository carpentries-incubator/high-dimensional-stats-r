# Introduction


# Believing in clusters

When doing clustering, it's important to realise that data may seem to
group together randomly. It's especially important to remember that when making
plots that add extra visual aids to distinguish clusters. For example, if we
cluster data from a single 2D normal distribution and draw ellipses around the
points, it suddenly is almost visually convincing. This is a somewhat extreme
example, since there is genuinely no heterogeneity in the data, but it does
reflect what can happen if you allow yourself to read too much into faint
signals.

# K-means

K-means is an iterative algorithm a bit like the EM algorithm we covered in
the previous lesson. However, in K-means we're not concerned with fitting
distributions to the data. We are only interested in distances.
In K-means, we pick $k$ initial points as centres or "centroids" of our
clusters. There are a few ways to choose these initial "centroids",
but for simplicity let's imagine we just pick three random co-ordinates.
We then follow these two steps until convergence:

1. Assign each point to the cluster with the closest centroid.
2. Update centroid positions as the average of the points in that cluster.

We can see this process in action in this animation:

We'll again load the scRNAseq data and calculate the first principal components.


~~~
library("SingleCellExperiment")
library("scater")

scrnaseq <- readRDS(here::here("data/scrnaseq.rds"))
scrnaseq <- runPCA(scrnaseq, ncomponents = 15)
pcs <- reducedDim(scrnaseq)[, 1:2]
~~~
{: .language-r}

We can then run K-means on the PCs of the scRNAseq data.

~~~
set.seed(42)
cluster <- kmeans(pcs, centers = 4)
scrnaseq$kmeans <- as.character(cluster$cluster)
plotReducedDim(scrnaseq, "PCA", colour_by = "kmeans")
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-09-kmeans-1.png" title="Alt" alt="Alt" width="432" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

We can see that this produces a sensible-looking partition of the data. 
However, is it totally clear whether there might be more or fewer clusters
here?

# Cluster separation

When performing clustering, it's important for us to be able to measure how
well our clusters are separated. One measure to test this is *silhouette width*.
For each data point, the silhouette width is the average distance
between this point and all other points in its cluster, relative to
the average distance of that point to the next closest cluster.
Ideally, we would have only large positive silhouette widths, indicating
that each data point is much more similar to than it is to the points in 
any other cluster. However, this is rarely the case. Often, points
clusters are very fuzzy, and even if we are relatively sure about
the existence of discrete groupings in the data, observations on the boundaries
can be difficult to confidently place in either cluster.

# Cluster robustness

When we cluster data, we want to be sure that the clusters we identify are
not a result of the exact properties fo the input data. That is, if the
data we observed were slightly different, the clusters we would identify
in this different data would be very similar. This makes it more
likely that these can be reproduced.

To assess this, we can use the *bootstrap*. What we do here is to take a sample
from the data with replacement. Sampling with replacement means that in the 
sample that we take, we can include points from the input data more than once.
This is maybe easier to see with an example. First, we define some data:


~~~
data <- 1:5
~~~
{: .language-r}

Then, we can take a sample from this data without replacement:

~~~
sample(data, 5)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 4 1 3 5 2
~~~
{: .output}

This sample is a subset of the original data, and points are only present once.
This is the case every time even if we do it many times:

~~~
## Each column is a sample
replicate(10, sample(data, 5))
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7] [,8] [,9] [,10]
[1,]    5    2    5    2    3    1    3    5    5     3
[2,]    4    5    4    5    4    4    1    3    1     2
[3,]    2    1    1    3    2    5    2    2    3     4
[4,]    1    4    2    1    5    3    5    1    2     5
[5,]    3    3    3    4    1    2    4    4    4     1
~~~
{: .output}

However, if we sample *with replacement*, then sometimes individual data points
are present more than once.


~~~
replicate(10, sample(data, 5, replace = TRUE))
~~~
{: .language-r}

In applying the bootstrap to clustering, we want to see two things:
1. Will observations within a cluster will consistently cluster together in
   different bootstrap replicates?
2. Will observations frequently swap between clusters?

In the plot below, the diagonal of the plot shows how often the clusters
are reproduced in boostrap replicates. High scores on
the diagonal mean that the clusters are consistently reproduced in each 
boostrap replicate. Similarly, the off-diagonal elements represent how often
observations swap between clusters in bootstrap replicates. High scores 
indicate that observations rarely swap between clusters.
