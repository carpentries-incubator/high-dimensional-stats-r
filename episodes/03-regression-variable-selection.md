title: "Feature selection for regression"
teaching: 45
exercises: 15
questions:
- "Why would we want to find a subset of features
  that are associated with an outcome?"
- "How should we *not* select features?"
- "How can we iteratively find a good subset of our features
  variables to use for regression?"
- "What are some risks and downsides of iterative feature
  selection?"
objectives:
- "Understand multiple regression in a biomedical context."
- "Understand how to fit a stepwise regression model."
keypoints:
- "Sets of features can be more predictive and provide
  a better explanation than a single feature alone."
- "Stepwise regression allows us to find a set of features that
  are associated with an outcome (eg, age)."
- "Stepwise regression is not very efficient."
# - "Stepwise regression will tend to retain only one
#   feature out of many that are correlated."
math: yes

# Intro

First, let's read in the data from the last lesson.



~~~
library("here")
library("minfi")
if (!file.exists(here("data/methylation.rds"))) {
    source(here("data/methylation.R"))
}
methylation <- readRDS(here("data/methylation.rds"))

methyl_mat <- t(assay(methylation))
age <- methylation$Age
~~~
{: .language-r}

# Why would we want to do feature selection?

In the previous lesson we did a kind of feature selection by doing
univariate analysis and thresholding by p-value/effect size.


However we might think there's some combination of methylation features
that combined explain age. For example, if we want to be able to predict age 
from methylation, that's a lot easier if we figure out what the contribution
of each feature is conditional on all others, rather than independent of
all others.

$$
    y_j = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \dots \beta_p X_p + \epsilon_j
$$

However when the number of predictors is greater than the number of samples
(basically always true in genetics) it isn't possible to include everything!

What happens if we try to fit a model here?


~~~
fit <- lm(age ~ methyl_mat)
summary(fit)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~

Call:
lm(formula = age ~ methyl_mat)

Residuals:
ALL 37 residuals are 0: no residual degrees of freedom!

                          Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)

Multiple R-squared:      1,	Adjusted R-squared:    NaN 
F-statistic:   NaN on 36 and 0 DF,  p-value: NA

So we can't do that mathematically, we have to find another way.

# Screening

What people sometimes do is to select variables based on correlation with
the outcome, or using a univariate modelling approach like we used in the 
previous lesson.
There's some problems with this! First, the p-values we get out of the final
model are meaningless because we're basically doing a 2-stage model and only
reporting one set of p-values (ignoring all the non-significant ones).
Secondly, we're likely to select a bunch of features that all have the same 
information!


~~~
nvar <- 1000
nobs <- 100
y_synth <- rnorm(nobs)
synth_mat <- matrix(rnorm(nobs * nvar), nrow = nobs, ncol = nvar)
cors <- apply(synth_mat, 2, function(col) cor(col, y_synth))
X_pred <- synth_mat[, abs(cors) > quantile(abs(cors), 0.99)]
summary(lm(y_synth ~ ., data = as.data.frame(X_pred)))
~~~

Amazing, the results are highly significant! However this isn't rigorous and
can lead to problems so don't do it!


# Best subset selection

However, we could imagine trying each combination of features to find which
is the best combination. This works, but is really computationally demanding,
because blah blah number of permutations probably $p!$ but need to check.



~~~
library("leaps")
small_methyl <- methyl_mat[, 1:10]
fit_all <- regsubsets(x = small_methyl, y = age, really.big = TRUE)
summ <- summary(fit_all)
coef(fit_all, which.min(summ$rss))
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
(Intercept)  cg00374717  cg00864867  cg01027739  cg01353448  cg01584473 
 145.118554    1.073187   13.767298   22.683667    9.489186  -14.784050

   4.853302    7.915842   -9.715682 
~~~
{: .output}

Let's try running BS on the full dataset.


~~~
fit_all <- regsubsets(x = methyl_mat, y = age, really.big = TRUE)
summ <- summary(fit_all)
coef(fit_all, which.min(summ$rss))
~~~
{: .language-r}

This doesn't really work in a reasonable time because of the number of possible
combinations!

# Model metrics

In the example above we used RSS (residual sum of squares) to choose a model.
However when comparing models with different numbers of features, this is
problematic. We could, for example, keep adding features that marginally 
reduce the RSS (because adding a feature will never make it worse!) and
under this framework we'll always select the biggest model.

For example, if we have as many features as observations, the fit is always
perfect.


~~~
nvar <- 100
nobs <- 100
y_synth <- rnorm(nobs)
X_synth <- matrix(rnorm(nobs * nvar), nrow = nobs, ncol = nvar)
fit <- lm(y_synth ~ 0 + ., data = as.data.frame(X_synth))
sum(residuals(fit)^2)
~~~
{: .language-r}

{: .output}

There are other ways to measure model performance while accounting for the
complexity of the model. For example, adjusted $R^2$ is similar to the normal
R^2 measure that estimates the variation explained by the model, while also
accounting for the number of features. This is explained
in more detail in [the multiple regression lesson](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/multiple-linear-regression-public-health/)

BIC and AIC also exist. There's also an issue of how well these things
will generalise beyond the present dataset.

# Forward stepwise selection

Since BS is computationally hard, we can instead do an approximation.
One of these is forward stepwise selection.

Basically:

1. pick the most significant feature
2. fit a model with that feature and every other
3. if any are a significant improvement, pick the model that has the best improvement
   and return to 2.
4. otherwise stop

Here we apply it to a synthetic methylation dataset where we know the true
predictors.

# Reverse stepwise selection

If we have a model that we think is real and we want to slim it down, we
can do reverse subset selection.

`methylclock::coefHorvath` is the Horvath methylation age predictor
[Horvath (2013)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24138928/).
