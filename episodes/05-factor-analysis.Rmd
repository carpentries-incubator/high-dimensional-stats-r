# Introduction

Biologists often encounter high-dimensional datasets from which they wish
to extract underlying features – they need to carry out dimensionality
reduction. The last episode dealt with one method to achieve this,
called principal component analysis (PCA), which expressed new dimension-reduced components 
as linear combinations of the original features in the dataset. Principal components can therefore 
be difficult to interpret. Here, we introduce a related but more interpretable
method called factor analysis (FA), which constructs new components, called _factors_, 
that explicitly represent underlying _(latent)_ constructs in our data. Like PCA, FA uses 
linear combinations, but uses latent constructs instead. FA is therefore often 
more interpretable and useful when we would like to extract meaning from our dimension-reduced
set of variables.

There are two types of FA, called exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis
(EFA and CFA). Both EFA and CFA aim to reproduce the observed relationships
among a group of features with a smaller set of latent variables. EFA
is used in a descriptive (exploratory) manner to uncover which
measured variables are reasonable indicators of the various latent dimensions.
In contrast, CFA is conducted in an _a priori_,
hypothesis-testing manner that requires strong empirical or theoretical foundations.
We will mainly focus on EFA here, which is used to group features into a specified
number of latent factors.

Unlike with PCA, researchers using FA have to specify the number of latent
variables (factors) at the point of running the analysis. Researchers may use
exploratory data analysis methods (including PCA) to provide an initial estimate
of how many factors adequately explain the variation observed in a dataset.
In practice, a range of different values is usually tested.

## Motivating example: student scores 

One scenario for using FA would be whether student scores in different subjects
can be summarised by certain subject categories. Take a look at the hypothetical
dataset below. If we were to run and EFA on this, we might find that the scores
can be summarised well by two factors, which we can then interpret. We have
labelled these hypothetical factors “mathematical ability” and “writing ability”.


```{r table, echo = FALSE, fig.cap="Student scores data across several subjects with hypothesised factors.", fig.alt="A table displaying data of student scores across several subjects. Each row displays the scores across different subjects for a given individual. The plot is annotated at the top with a curly bracket labelled Factor 1: mathematical ability and encompasses the data for the student scores is Arithmetic, Algebra, Geometry, and Statistics. Similarly, the subjects Creative Writing, Literature, Spelling/Grammar are encompassed by a different curly bracket with label Factor 2: writing ability."}

# ![Figure 1: Student exam scores per subject. Subjects can be split into two factors representing mathematical ability and writing ability](D:/Statistical consultancy/Consultancy/Grant applications/UKRI teaching grant 2021/Working materials/Table for FA.png)
```
So, EFA is designed to identify a specified number of unobservable factors from
observable features contained in the original dataset. This is slightly
different from PCA, which does not do this directly. Just to recap, PCA creates
as many principal components as there are features in the dataset, each
component representing a different linear combination of features. The principal
components are ordered by the amount of variance they account for.


# Prostate cancer patient data

We revisit the prostate dataset of 97 men who have prostate cancer.
Although not strictly a high-dimensional dataset, as with other episodes,
we use this dataset to explore the method.

In this example, we use the clinical variables to identify factors representing
various clinical variables from prostate cancer patients. Two principal
components have already been identified as explaining a large proportion
of variance in the data when these data were analysed in the PCA episode.
We may expect a similar number of factors to exist in the data.

Let's subset the data to just include the log-transformed clinical variables
for the purposes of this episode:

```{r prostate}
library("here")
prostate <- readRDS(here("data/prostate.rds"))
```


```{r dims}
nrow(prostate)
head(prostate)

#select five log-transformed clinical variables for further analysis
pros2 <- prostate[, c("lcavol", "lweight", "lbph", "lcp", "lpsa")]
head(pros2)
```

# Performing exploratory factor analysis

EFA may be implemented in R using the `factanal()` function
from the **`stats`** package (which is a built-in package in base R). This
function fits a factor analysis by maximising the log-likelihood using a
data matrix as input. The number of factors to be fitted in the analysis
is specified by the user using the `factors` argument.

The output of `factanal()` shows the loadings for each of the input variables
associated with each factor. The loadings are values between -1 and 1 which
represent the relative contribution each input variable makes to the factors.
Positive values show that these variables are positively related to the
factors, while negative values show a negative relationship between variables
and factors. Loading values are missing for some variables because R does not
print loadings less than 0.1. 

# How many factors do we need?

There are numerous ways to select the “best” number of factors. One is to use
the minimum number of features that does not leave a significant amount of
variance unaccounted for. In practice, we repeat the factor
analysis for different numbers of factors (by specifying different values 
in the `factors` argument). If we have an idea of how many factors there 
will be before analysis, we can start with that number. The final 
section of the analysis output then shows the results of
a hypothesis test in which the null hypothesis is that the number of factors
used in the model is sufficient to capture most of the variation in the
dataset. If the p-value is less than our significance level (for example 0.05),
we reject the null hypothesis that the number of factors is sufficient and we repeat the analysis with 
more factors. When the p-value is greater than our significance level, we do not reject 
the null hypothesis that the number of factors used captures variation
in the data. We may therefore conclude that 
this number of factors is sufficient. 

Like PCA, the fewer factors that can explain most of the variation in the
dataset, the better. It is easier to explore and interpret results using a
smaller number of factors which represent underlying features in the data. 

# Variance accounted for by factors - communality and uniqueness

The *communality* of a variable is the sum of its squared loadings. It
represents the proportion of the variance in a variable that is accounted
for by the FA model.

*Uniqueness* is the opposite of communality and represents the amount of
variation in a variable that is not accounted for by the FA model. Uniqueness is
calculated by subtracting the communality value from 1. If uniqueness is high for
a given variable, that means this variable is not well explained/accounted for
by the factors identified.

```{r common-unique}
apply(pros_fa$loadings^2, 1, sum)  #communality
1 - apply(pros_fa$loadings^2, 1, sum)  #uniqueness
```

# Visualising the contribution of each variable to the factors
Similar to a biplot as we produced in the PCA episode, we can “plot the
loadings”. This shows how each original variable contributes to each of
the factors we chose to visualise.

```{r biplot, fig.cap = "Factor 2 loadings versus factor 1 loadings for each feature.", fig.alt="A scatter plot of the factor 2 loadings for each feature versus the factor 2 loadings for each feature. The lpsa, lcavol and lcp feature points are located in the east of the plot, indicating a high loading on factor 1 and close to zero loading on factor 2. The lbph and lweight features are located in the north of the plot, indicating a close to zero loading on factor 1 and a high loading on factor 2."}
#First, carry out factor analysis using two factors
pros_fa <- factanal(pros2, factors = 2)

#plot loadings for each factor
plot(
  pros_fa$loadings[, 1], 
  pros_fa$loadings[, 2],
  xlab = "Factor 1", 
  ylab = "Factor 2", 
  ylim = c(-1, 1),
  xlim = c(-1, 1),
  main = "Factor analysis of prostate data"
)
abline(h = 0, v = 0)

#add column names to each point
text(
  pros_fa$loadings[, 1] - 0.08, 
  pros_fa$loadings[, 2] + 0.08,
  colnames(pros2),
  col = "blue"
)
```

# Advantages and disadvantages of Factor Analysis

There are several advantages and disadvantages of using FA as a
dimensionality reduction method.

Advantages:

* FA is a useful way of combining different groups of data into known
  representative factors, thus reducing dimensionality in a dataset.
* FA can take into account researchers' expert knowledge when choosing
  the number of factors to use, and can be used to identify latent or hidden
  variables which may not be apparent from using other analysis methods.
* It is easy to implement with many software tools available to carry out FA.
* Confirmatory FA can be used to test hypotheses.

Disadvantages:

* Justifying the choice of
  number of factors to use may be difficult if little is known about the
  structure of the data before analysis is carried out.
* Sometimes, it can be difficult to interpret what factors mean after
  analysis has been completed. 
* Like PCA, standard methods of carrying out FA assume that input variables
  are continuous, although extensions to FA allow ordinal and binary
  variables to be included (after transforming the input matrix).
