# What are high-dimensional data? 

*High-dimensional data* are defined as data in which the number of features (variables observed),
$p$, are close to or larger than the number of observations (or data points), $n$.
The opposite is *low-dimensional data* in which the number of observations,
$n$, far outnumbers the number of features, $p$. A related concept is *wide data*, which
refers to data with numerous features irrespective of the number of observations (similarly,
*tall data* is often used to denote data with a large number of observations).
Analyses of high-dimensional data require consideration of potential problems that
come from having more features than observations.

High-dimensional data have become more common in many scientific fields as new
automated data collection techniques have been developed. More and more datasets
have a large number of features and some have as many features as there are rows
in the dataset. Datasets in which $p$>=$n$ are becoming more common. Such datasets
pose a challenge for data analysis as standard methods of analysis, such as linear
regression, are no longer appropriate.

High-dimensional datasets are common in the biological sciences. Subjects like
genomics and medical sciences often use both tall (in terms of $n$) and wide
(in terms of $p$) datasets that can be difficult to analyse or visualise using
standard statistical tools. An example of high-dimensional data in biological
sciences may include data collected from hospital patients recording symptoms,
blood test results, behaviours, and general health, resulting in datasets with
large numbers of features. Researchers often want to relate these features to
specific patient outcomes (e.g. survival, length of time spent in hospital).
An example of what high-dimensional data might look like in a biomedical study
is shown in the figure below.

Now that we have an idea of what high-dimensional data look like we can think
about the challenges we face in analysing them.


# Challenges in dealing with high-dimensional data 

Most classical statistical methods are set up for use on low-dimensional data
(i.e. data where the number of observations $n$ is much larger than the number
of features $p$). This is because low-dimensional data were much more common in
the past when data collection was more difficult and time consuming. In recent
years advances in information technology have allowed large amounts of data to
be collected and stored with relative ease. This has allowed large numbers of
features to be collected, meaning that datasets in which $p$ matches or exceeds
$n$ are common (collecting observations is often more difficult or expensive
than collecting many features from a single observation).

Datasets with large numbers of features are difficult to visualise. When
exploring low-dimensional datasets, it is possible to plot the response variable
against each of the limited number of explanatory variables to get an idea which
of these are important predictors of the response. With high-dimensional data
the large number of explanatory variables makes doing this difficult. In some
high-dimensional datasets it can also be difficult to identify a single response
variable, making standard data exploration and analysis techniques less useful.

Let's have a look at a simple dataset with lots of features to understand some
of the challenges we are facing when working with high-dimensional data.

Imagine we are carrying out least squares regression on a dataset with 25
observations. Fitting a best fit line through these data produces a plot shown
in the left-hand panel of the figure below.

However, imagine a situation in which the number of observations and features in a
dataset are almost equal. In that situation the effective number of observations
per features is low. The result of fitting a best fit line through
few observations can be seen in the right-hand panel below.

```{r intro-figure, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../fig/intro-scatterplot.png")
# ![Figure 2: Least squares regression using a) low-dimensional data and b) low ratio of observations per feature](D:/Statistical consultancy/Consultancy/Grant applications/UKRI teaching grant 2021/Working materials/Figure 2 for Intro.png)
```

In the first situation, the least squares regression line does not fit the data
perfectly and there is some error around the regression line. But, when there are
only two observations the regression line will fit through the points exactly,
resulting in overfitting of the data. This suggests that carrying out least
squares regression on a dataset with few data points per feature would result
in difficulties in applying the resulting model to further datsets. This is a
common problem when using regression on high-dimensional datasets.

Another problem in carrying out regression on high-dimensional data is dealing
with correlations between explanatory variables. The large numbers of features
in these datasets makes high correlations between variables more likely.

Including highly correlated variables such as `gleason` and `pgg45` 
simultaneously the same regression model can lead to problems 
in fitting a regression model and interpreting its output. To allow variables to 
be included in the same model despite high levels of correlation, we can use
dimensionality reduction methods to collapse multiple variables into a single
new variable (we will explore this dataset further in the dimensionality
reduction lesson). We can also use modifications to linear regression like
regularisation, which we will discuss in the lesson on high-dimensional
regression.


# What statistical methods are used to analyse high-dimensional data? 

As we found out in the above challenges, carrying out linear regression on
datasets with large numbers of features is difficult due to: high levels of correlation
between variables; difficulty in identifying a clear response variable; and risk
of overfitting. These problems are common to the analysis of many high-dimensional datasets,
for example, those using genomics data with multiple genes, or species
composition data in an environment where the relative abundance of different species
within a community is of interest. For such datasets, other statistical methods
may be used to examine whether groups of observations show similar characteristics
and whether these groups may relate to other features in the data (e.g.
phenotype in genetics data). 

In this course we will cover four topics: (1) regression with numerous outcome 
variables, (2) regularised regression, (3) dimensionality reduction, and (4) 
clustering. Here are some examples for when each of these approaches may be used:

(1) Regression with numerous outcomes refers to situations in which there are 
many variables of a similar kind (expression values for many genes, methylation 
levels for many sites in the genome) and when one is interested in assessing 
whether these variables are associated with a specific covariate of interest, 
such as experimental condition or age. In this case, multiple univariate 
regression models (one per each outcome, using the covariate of interest as 
predictor) could be fitted independently. In the context of high-dimensional 
molecular data, a typical example are *differential gene expression* analyses. 
We will explore this type of analysis in the *Regression with many outcomes* episode.

(2) Regularisation (also known as *regularised regression* or *penalised regression*) 
is typically used to fit regression models when there is a single outcome 
variable or interest but the number of potential predictors is large, e.g. 
there are more predictors than observations. Regularisation can help to prevent 
over-fitting and may be used to identify a small subset of predictors that are
associated with the outcome of interest. For example, regularised regression has
been often used when building *epigenetic clocks*, where methylation values 
across several thousands of genomic sites are used to predict chronological age. 
We will explore this in more detail in the *Regularised regression* episode. 

(3) Dimensionality reduction is commonly used on high dimensional datasets for 
data exploration or as a preprocessing step prior to other downstream analyses. 
For instance, a low-dimensional visualisation of a gene expression dataset may
be used to inform *quality control* steps (e.g. are there any anomalous samples?). 
This course contains two episodes that explore dimensionality reduction
techniques: *Principal component analysis* and *Factor analysis*. 

(4) Clustering methods can be used to identify potential grouping patterns 
within a dataset. A popular example is the *identification of distinct cell types*
through clustering cells with similar gene expression patterns. The *K-means*
episode will explore a specific method to perform clustering analysis.
