# What are high-dimensional data? 

*High-dimensional data* are defined as data in which the number of features (variables observed),
$p$, are close to or larger than the number of observations (or data points), $n$.
The opposite is *low-dimensional data* in which the number of observations,
$n$, far outnumbers the number of features, $p$. A related concept is *wide data*, which

efers to data with numerous features irrespective of the number of observations (similarly, *tall data* is often used to denote data with a large number of observations)
Analyses of high-dimensional data require consideration of potential problems that
come from having more features than observations.


High-dimensional data have become more common in many scientific fields as new
automated data collection techniques have been developed. More and more datasets
have a large number of features and some have as many features as there are rows
in the dataset. Datasets in which $p$>=$n$ are becoming more common. Such datasets
pose a challenge for data analysis as standard methods of analysis, such as linear
regression, are no longer appropriate.

High-dimensional datasets are common in the biological sciences. Subjects like
genomics and medical sciences often use both tall (in terms of $n$) and wide

(in terms of $p$) datasets that can be difficult to analyse or visualise using
standard statistical tools. An example of high-dimensional data in biological
sciences may include data collected from hospital patients recording symptoms,
blood test results, behaviours, and general health, resulting in datasets with
large numbers of features. Researchers often want to relate these features to
specific patient outcomes (e.g. survival, length of time spent in hospital).
An example of what high-dimensional data might look like in a biomedical study
is shown in the figure below.

Now that we have an idea of what high-dimensional data look like we can think
about the challenges we face in analysing them.


# Challenges in dealing with high-dimensional data 

Most classical statistical methods are set up for use on low-dimensional data
(i.e. data where the number of observations $n$ is much larger than the number
of features $p$). This is because low-dimensional data were much more common in
the past when data collection was more difficult and time consuming. In recent
years advances in information technology have allowed large amounts of data to
be collected and stored with relative ease. This has allowed large numbers of
features to be collected, meaning that datasets in which $p$ matches or exceeds
$n$ are common (collecting observations is often more difficult or expensive
than collecting many features from a single observation).

Datasets with large numbers of features are difficult to visualise. When
exploring low-dimensional datasets, it is possible to plot the response variable
against each of the limited number of explanatory variables to get an idea which
of these are important predictors of the response. With high-dimensional data
the large number of explanatory variables makes doing this difficult. In some
high-dimensional datasets it can also be difficult to identify a single response
variable, making standard data exploration and analysis techniques less useful.

Let's have a look at a simple dataset with lots of features to understand some
of the challenges we are facing when working with high-dimensional data.

Imagine we are carrying out least squares regression on a dataset with 25
observations. Fitting a best fit line through these data produces a plot shown
in the left-hand panel of the figure below.

However, imagine a situation in which the ratio of observations to features in
In that situation the effective number of

observations per features is low. The result of fitting a best fit line through
few observations can be seen in the right-hand panel below.

```{r intro-figure, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../fig/intro-scatterplot.png")
# ![Figure 2: Least squares regression using a) low-dimensional data and b) low ratio of observations per feature](D:/Statistical consultancy/Consultancy/Grant applications/UKRI teaching grant 2021/Working materials/Figure 2 for Intro.png)
```

In the first situation, the least squares regression line does not fit the data
perfectly and there is some error around the regression line. But, when there are
only two observations the regression line will fit through the points exactly,
resulting in overfitting of the data. This suggests that carrying out least
squares regression on a dataset with few data points per feature would result
in difficulties in applying the resulting model to further datsets. This is a
common problem when using regression on high-dimensional datasets.

Another problem in carrying out regression on high-dimensional data is dealing
with correlations between explanatory variables. The large numbers of features
in these datasets makes high correlations between variables more likely.

The correlation matrix shows high correlation between some pairs of variables
(e.g. between `lcavol` and `lpsa` and between `gleason` and `pgg45`). Including
correlated variables in the same regression model can lead to problems in fitting
a regression and interpreting the output. Some clinical variables
(i.e. `lcavol`, `lweight`, `lbph`, `lcp`, `lpsa`) show high correlation between
pairs of variables (e.g. between `lcavol` and `lpsa`). To allow variables to be
included in the same model despite high levels of correlation we can use
dimensionality reduction methods to collapse multiple variables into a single
new variable (we will explore this dataset further in the dimensionality
reduction lesson). We can also use modifications to linear regression like
regularisation, which we will discuss in the lesson on high-dimensional
regression.


# What statistical methods are used to analyse high-dimensional data? 

As we found out in the above challenges, carrying out linear regression on
datasets with large numbers of features is difficult due to: high correlation
between variables; difficulty in identifying a clear response variable; and risk
of overfitting. These problems are common to the analysis of many high-dimensional datasets,
for example, those using genomics data with multiple genes, or species
composition data in an environment where the relative abundance of different species
within a community is of interest. For such datasets, other statistical methods
may be used to examine whether groups of observations show similar features
and whether these groups may relate to other features in the data (e.g.
phenotype in genetics data). While straight-forward linear regression cannot
be used in datasets with many features, high-dimensional regression methods
are available with methods to deal with overfitting and fitting models including
many explanatory variables.

In situations where the response variable is difficult to identify or where
explanatory variables are highly correlated, dimensionality reduction may be
used to create fewer variables that represent the variation in the original dataset.
Various dimensionality reduction methods are available, including principal
component analysis (PCA), factor analysis, and multidimensional scaling, which
are used to address different types of research questions. Dimensionality
reduction methods such as PCA can also be used to visualise data in fewer
dimensions, making patterns and clusters within the data easier to
visualise. Exploring data via clustering is a good way of understanding
relationships within observations in complex datasets.

Statistical methods (such as hierarchical clustering and k-means clustering)
are often used to identify clusters within complex datasets. However, simply
identifying clusters visually may not be enough - we also need to determine
whether such clusters are 'real' or simply apparent interpretations of noise
within the data.

Let's create some random data and show how we can create clusters by changing
parameters.

```{r plot-random}
set.seed(80)     

## create random data from a normal distribution and store as a matrix
x <- matrix(rnorm(200, mean = 0, sd = 1), 100, 2)

plot(x, pch = 19)

## create three groups for each row of x
selected <- sample(1:3, 100, replace = TRUE)

## plot x and colour by selected
plot(x, col = selected, pch = 19)
#note there are no clusters in these data

## create random data representing mean of each of the three groups
xsel <- matrix(rnorm(6, mean = 0, sd = 1), 3, 2)
#Note how increasing the value of sd makes clusters clearer

## add values of x to xsel for each of three defined groups
xgroups <- x + xsel[selected, ]
## plot xgroups and colour by each of the three groups
plot(xgroups, col = selected, pch = 19)
```
