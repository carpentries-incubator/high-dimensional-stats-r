It's usually recommended that course instructors provide a virtual environment
with software and data available. However this page includes instructions
to set up for the lessons. This should take about an hour to run, depending on
the speed of your computer, your internet connection, and any packages you have
installed already. You'll need to install R 4.0 or later.

The following code will download the data and install the libraries
used in the current version of this lesson:

```r
install.packages("BiocManager")
download.file(
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carpentries-incubator/high-dimensional-stats-r/gh-pages/dependencies.csv",
    destfile = 'dependencies.csv'
)
table <- read.table('dependencies.csv')
BiocManager::install(table[[1]])

dir.create("data", showWarnings = FALSE)
data_files <- c(
    "cancer_expression.rds",
    "coefHorvath.rds",
    "methylation.rds",
    "scrnaseq.rds",
    "prostate.rds"
)
for (file in data_files) {
    download.file(
        url = file.path(
            "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carpentries-incubator/high-dimensional-stats-r/gh-pages/data",
            file
        ),
        destfile = file.path("data", file)
    )
}
```
